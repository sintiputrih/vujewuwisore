She has a high goal of playing without emotion. Her profession as a preschool aide, living with a house of children, should help her by the end of this.</p><p>According to this Big Brother House Guest, the most difficult part of living in the Big Brother house, for her, will be making sure that she thinks before she speaks out. Another hard task will be trying to shut when she really wants to tell someone off. She said that she would rather bite her tongue to succeed in doing that. However, Nicole admits to doing that every single day at work, so at least she has had practice.</p><p>A locked journal would keep her going during her free time as she writes her experiences, opinions, and much more. She will then compare them to the real events later. Besides that, Nicole needs a journal to keep track of important information for competitions. The preschool aide will also need her iPod because she has all her songs on it: the ones that calm her down, the ones that pump her up, and a lot more other songs.</p><p>Another thing that Nicole Anthony would take in the house is a book, any book. She would need this for her English language arts mind to have something to read and analyze.</p><p>The Big Brother houseguest that Nicole Anthony liked the most was Paul Abrahamian. He was authentically himself, didn’t mind anyone’s business, and ran that house while most everyone else mindlessly followed. She admired his ability to stay true to himself and not feel the need to apologize or explain his reasons. Abrahamian played the game and played it well.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=strategy-for-winning></span><span>Strategy for winning</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicole Anthony has a strategy for winning the game. Her plan is to play it as authentically and objectively as she can. In other words, she wants to be herself and connect with people on real, personal levels while also remembering to play the game non-emotionally for what it is, a game. The preschool aide also adds that even though the other houseguests are her game pieces, they are still people.</p><p>To get ahead of this summer’s show better known as a game, see the following fun facts about Nicole Anthony. The first fact is that Nicole has played all of the Nancy Drew video games since she enjoys solving puzzles and mysteries.<br>Moreover, she was a bit of a terror when she was young, locking her parents in the basement because they would not tell her what was in a bag.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nicole-anthony-ovi-kabir></span><span><strong>Nicole Anthony </strong>Ovi Kabir</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>University of Tennessee alumnus and “Big Brother” houseguest Ovi Kabir is no fan of bullies, and he made that clear on Wednesday’s episode(July 17, 2019) of the CBS reality show. He called out the members of the Gr8tful alliance: Analyse Talvera, Christie Murphy, Holly Allen, Isabella Wang, Jack Matthews, Jackson Michie, Nick Maccarone, and Tommy Bracco, for shutting out Nicole Anthony from the Head of Household room and making fun of her.</p><p>Nicole Anthony received the ire of the Gr8tful alliance after telling Wang and current Head of Household Maccarone that they were being targeted by other members of their alliance. She was correct. Jackson Michie told her he was planning to target Wang and Maccarone. When Nicole relayed that information to Wang and Maccarone, at first, they believed her.</p><p>However, Wang and Maccarone changed their minds when they talked to the other Gr8tful members about what Nicole Anthony told them. The members denied targeting Wang and Maccarone, got angry, and then started calling her names.</p><p>Jackson Michie, who also is a former University of Tennessee student, closed the door on Nicole Anthony when she tried to come to the Head of Household room to talk to the group. Ovi Kabir saw it happen, and he told the group through the door (because they wouldn’t let him in either) that it wasn’t cool or nice to do that to Nicole.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-ovi-stood-up-for-nicole></span><span>Why Ovi stood up for Nicole</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ovi Kabir elaborated during a confessional, bringing up that he was bullied in the past. “When I saw Nicole being kicked out of the HoH room like that, it didn’t sit well with me because I experienced a lot of bullying growing up,” he said. “That’s affected me throughout my whole life, and it is a sore spot when I see people treat others in a way they shouldn’t. I might be a 5’7″ brown boy, but no one’s going to intimidate me.”</p><p>The Gr8tful alliance wasn’t pleased with Kabir standing up for Nicole.” Honestly, Ovi should’ve kept his mouth shut,” said Christie Murphy. Kabir talked to Jack Matthews later and asked if everything was OK. Their conversation was tense, and Matthews didn’t say much to Kabir.</p><p>“Jack is really disrespectful actually,” said Ovi Kabir in a confessional. “Some people in this game feel like they can intimidate others and threaten them with words, but I’m more determined than ever to get back in this game because I’m going to change this house”</p><p>Kabir, who has voted out a few weeks ago, is a part of “Big Brother’s” Camp Comeback twist this season, where the first four houseguests voted out to get to stay in the house and have a chance to return to the game. Ovi Kabir got his chance to return on Thursday’s episode.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=americas-favorite-player></span><span>America’s Favorite Player</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Several blogs surrounding the show regularly conduct polls over the season’s favorite houseguests, asking viewers who they like the most. &nbsp;One of the most popular live feeds recap websites which also has a stellar following on Twitter is Big Brother Daily. The site conducts a poll every day to see who the fans love the most, and Season 21 seems to have one major standout.</p><p>Nicole Anthony has been the favorite houseguest of the season for a month now, after being chosen every single day over her other roommates. Big Brother Daily lets its users rank all of the 16 houseguests in order from favorite to least favorite and quantifies all the votes into points. Nicole has been leading for a month, which seems to line up with the sentiments regarding her on social media.</p><p>For the last two weeks, the second and third favorite houseguests have fluctuated between Cliff Hogg and Kathryn Dunn. Sam Smith and David Alexander also rounded out the top 5, with appearances from Jessica Milagros and Kemi Fakunle as well.</p><p>Almost as interesting as Nicole Anthony’s spot at the top, are some of the lowest-ranked houseguests. Jackson Michie and Jack Matthews have both taken over the last place spot, proving that they are some of the least-liked players in the game when it comes to the viewer’s opinions.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-nicole-anthony></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Nicole Anthony</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-nicole-anthony></span><span>Who is Nicole Anthony?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicole is an American reality TV star who shot to fame after she appeared on Big Brother US season 21.
