The following year,&nbsp;Las Culturistas&nbsp;held its first live show in New York featuring more than 50 comedians. It’s since&nbsp;become a women-and-queers cultural staple with an <a href=#>enormous</a> and <a href=#>passionate</a> fan base, and, since 2022, a live annual awards show. Partly a parody of the EGOTs, the Las Culturistas Culture Awards is the only time each year the pair is in a room with their listeners. Throughout the ceremony, Rogers and Yang celebrate the podcast’s annual highlights (via segments like <a href=#>reading their iconic Kraft Mac & Cheese ad</a> as a group) and flex their impressive Hollywood networking skills. Cate Blanchett, Andy Cohen, and Ariana Grande —&nbsp;the type of people who used to be only discussed on the show — have sent in video “acceptance speeches” in the past.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9ss00j001e3b86y0j40hx8@published data-word-count=113>A lot has changed about the Las Culturistas universe since they first vowed to “attack culture.” The most alluring aspect of the podcast was Rogers and Yang approaching it like a mutual diary. Over the years, they’ve shared nearly everything with listeners; stories about their sex lives, personal opinions on Taylor Swift, which drag queens annoy them, and what drugs they or their guests did that weekend were all on the table. But with the podcast winning <a href=#>multiple</a> awards, Yang <a href=#>starring on SNL</a>, and Rogers cementing his Prince of Christmas status through a <a href=#>Showtime special</a> and <a href=#>Capitol Records album</a>, the pair have begun to reassess the overly candid approach of the podcast’s infancy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9ss00k001f3b86s1e47ezb@published data-word-count=117>Now, armed with more fame, success, and <a href=#>viral advice from Tina Fey</a>, Rogers and Yang are gearing up for the 2024 Culture Awards at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn on June 15. According to showrunner and executive producer Lauren Mandel, the guests will include Hannah Einbinder, <a href=#>Cole Escola</a>, Julio Torres, Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson, Heather McMahan, Julia Fox, and Tomás Matos, plus Sabrina Carpenter, who is set to make a “special video appearance” as the personification of “summer.” It’s going to be big, it’s going to have culture, and it will be the kind of whimsical delight that leaves nasty questions of “authenticity” at home in favor of glorious stupidity. Thank God there’s still space for that.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx97oc9b002b3b71zqy8idox@published data-word-count=153><strong>Right before the pandemic began, I remember a topic on Las Culturistas </strong><a href=#><strong>was how to record the podcast</strong></a><strong> moving forward. Matt had just moved to L.A., so the options were either to record episodes on separate coasts via Zoom or bank non-topical episodes when you were together. How do you think of those two mediums now?</strong><br><strong>Matt Rogers: </strong>The way I think about it is, How can we accomplish getting an episode out week to week? That is what we do, and we make the best of whatever situation it is. Ideally, Bowen and I are in the same place — not just for the podcast but for friendship. Sometimes, virtual is the only way to accomplish it and then we make the best of it. But do I like doing the podcast virtually? No. The energy when we’re in person with each other or with the guest makes the podcast what it is.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63e001f3b80umztmyar@published data-word-count=64><strong>Bowen Yang:</strong> Which is not to devalue moments that come out of a virtual recording setup where we will have wonderful conversations. I tend to not necessarily mind the one-on-one episodes where it’s just Matt and I on Zoom, because we have been able to modulate our friendship and our dynamic in enough ways now to have it work outside of real-time spatial concurrence.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63e001g3b80thooouut@published data-word-count=81><strong>M.R.: </strong>The Zoom episodes with guests feel more like interviews in a way that I personally don’t like. When Las Culturistas feels like a conversation between two or three people, that’s what’s fun about it. The pandemic forcing us virtual made it seem like this was an interview podcast, and it’s not. Online, we’re quietly listening and then giving space after an answer to really absorb, and that’s not who we are. We’re not interviewers. We’re comedians, we’re fools, we’re clowns.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63f001h3b80quhhn250@published data-word-count=61><strong>I’m curious about the one-on-one episodes. Prior to 2019, those were extremely uncommon. What was the benefit to including episodes that just feature the two of you chatting?</strong><br><strong>B.Y.:</strong> Matt and I are true “variety” people. We do well in different configurations, whether it’s Matt singing original, <a href=#>beautiful Christmas songs onstage by himself</a> or me being on this multi-cam live sketch show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63f001i3b800ebrcyws@published data-word-count=16><strong>M.R.: </strong>You’re not saying the name of the show.

That all gets poured into the show, where we have thoughtful or not-so-thoughtful conversations about things that happen, as they happen. Sometimes, that’s best served by him and I just having a conversation that is frivolous and maybe sometimes emotional, too vulnerable, a little cringey, whatever. By keeping the podcast low-concept, it has given us a high ceiling to try all these different kinds of things.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63f001k3b8054vx6hvw@published data-word-count=57><strong>M.R.:</strong> Any given episode of the show is one we wanted to put out.

What was the value of that vulnerability?</strong><br><strong>B.Y.: </strong>It goes back to the low-concept thing. The best decision we ever made with the podcast was before the podcast even started: We had all these ideas that were incredibly complicated and high-concept, then Matt was like, “What if it’s just the two of us as ourselves talking about pop culture?” That gave us so much latitude to react in the moment so it would always end up being personal. Over the years, we’ve learned to temper the response a little bit in a way that benefits everybody.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63h001s3b80u05h2xcq@published data-word-count=90><strong>During the early days, I heard about your trying LSD and about Matt’s <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>breakup with Henry.</span> It felt like the listener was getting a record of your lives off the show — why was that worthwhile?</strong><br><strong>M.R.: </strong>It was a classic case of not knowing any better. We started this podcast with the idea that it was going to be just for us. We did not think this was going to be a thing. It was a totally different world. We were anti-Reputation, by Taylor Swift. And we were so wrong.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63h001t3b80v8xu6fjp@published data-word-count=110>You mentioned my breakup with Henry. At the time, I felt like I wasn’t saying anything that the people listening didn’t already know because they were my friends. There was a lack of care for him in my oversharing, and that became an issue in our relationship. But several years later, I went through one of the most difficult times of my life with another person. I was keeping so much back from the podcast. That’s when I realized things had changed —&nbsp;not only because of the way it affects other people but also because I’m now very aware that a lot of people listen to this, and it’s hard.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63i001u3b80k41t0nnr@published data-word-count=76>When you refer to it as diaristic, for ten years I always said to myself, I wish I kept a diary. And then I realized I have been keeping a diary. I don’t think I could write out something more in-depth than what we’ve shared in episodes.

I’ve used Honesty Zone at SNL with producers. Honesty Zone for the podcast is something specific, but Honesty Zone in any other setting, professional or personal, is about giving space for honest thoughts to be shared. If we were just completely engineering the artifice of the show and the friendship, then that would come off as instantly legible by the listener. Honesty Zone is our way of figuring out where the supply-and-demand curves meet in terms of how honest the audience wants us to be. And sometimes, the demand for honesty is way higher than what we are able to supply.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63j001x3b8094tdjqjn@published data-word-count=50><strong>M.R.: </strong>There are real stakes in our careers now because we’re talented and have worked really hard. So if that comes at the expense of someone’s experience, then adjust what you want from us. Also, the podcast is not that fucking different.

Matt and I both have our individual death drives. We have our ways of courting danger or walking to the edge. I was just talking about this in therapy today. I feel like I have built the guardrails for myself in the past year on the pod, off the pod at my day job — I still won’t name it. I do feel like there is this sense of restricted vernacular. We are finding the words in real time, and Honesty Zone is a way to release the valve.

Maybe they were picking up on the fact that I had been in Vegas for 72 hours and didn’t sleep.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63n002i3b809tb49vb1@published data-word-count=133>I think my and Bowen’s relationships to the audience are a little bit different. I think there is a familiarity between me and the <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>Kayteighs</span> because I am not super A-list famous. I think they feel the need to, in a way, keep me close to them. I take it very personally when they feel disappointed in me. I’m also very sensitive — not to say Bowen isn’t, but Bowen has had to build up different armors. I’m building up those armors now. It can come across as maybe a little bit combative, but it’s because I’m hurt by the insinuation that I’m not doing a good job at this anymore. And I do think this is a very vocal minority, but it’s something I’m in my head about. And that’s Honesty Zone.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63n002j3b80qrofierl@published data-word-count=101><strong>B.Y.: </strong>Matt, I wish I could get you out of that cell. My relationship with the audience is that I recede a bit. I feel like Matt is, in a lot of ways, the main character of Las Culturistas. I am there as an audience surrogate, to receive his opinions and validate them or sometimes challenge them. That’s where I am right now because I am receding just in general in my life; in the real world, I’m going to withdraw a bit. The podcast will always reflect something about where we are in our lives as friends and as individuals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> Yang and Rogers at the 2023 LCCAs.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63o002k3b80x1ssgndv@published data-word-count=179><strong>You both describe having a complicated relationship with your audience. When you do a live show, like the Culture Awards, do those complexities color being in the same room with your fans?</strong><br><strong>B.Y.:</strong> At this point, the Culture Awards is the only live show I do in the year, my day job notwithstanding. Since the pandemic, I have not done really any live shows, and for now, I’m really grateful for the Culture Awards for being this beautiful extension of the podcast. It is also budding in its own way and separating from that initial mass, so I am isolating it and treating it as its own project. Part of that is me being this performer in front of an audience based on material that I’ve written — it’s not that someone else has written me as a <a href=#>panda talking next to Joe Biden</a> — and being in a self-engendered environment for me to perform in. I really, really like that. I think I’ve spoiled myself for the rest of my life and career by performing exclusively in that space.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63q002l3b804k1c7zbe@published data-word-count=126><strong>M.R.:</strong> The root of my frustration at the disappointment the audience&nbsp;might feel or about their perceptions about the podcast changing is because I love them so much. They’ve given us everything. And I feel like when I go on tour for my Christmas shows [starts tearing up] I know where all those people came from, and so [chokes up], oh God, I don’t know why I’m feeling like this. We just want to do a good job, and when so many people come and so many people give you so much love, you want to give everything back. It feels like so much love in the room and so much excitement in the room. Everyone’s in it to be themselves and laugh at this stupid shit.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx9bs63q002m3b806201smj6@published data-word-count=55><strong>Where does Las Culturistas go from here?</strong><br><strong>B.Y.: </strong>I think between Matt and I, there is a vision for how we put the essence of Las Cultch into other things.
