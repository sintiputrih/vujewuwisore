Merri Brown announced Bonnie’s death on Instagram a few days later. Her lengthy post began as follows:</p><p>“76 years and 17 days was insufficient time for the world to feel this beautiful woman’s beautiful spirit. This woman’s life mission was to give, love, and serve. This woman only knew how to do things for other people. This woman would give up everything for you. She was a strong, resilient, and compassionate woman. This woman was always a safe place to land, no matter where or when. This woman, this lovely lady, my mother.”</p><p>The TLC star went on to say:</p><p>“She left us abruptly, unexpectedly, and far too soon, and I literally don’t know what I’m going to do with the rest of my life without her.”</p><p>Meri finished her statement by writing:</p><p>“Mom, I love you more than words can express, but I know you already know that. You are loved, you are missed, and I know you are celebrating with dad on the other side, hugging your daughter and son who left us too soon, reuniting with your parents, and getting to know your father. Be happy, love them all, and hug them all. Alternatively, just keep filling the space around you with the light that you always do. Mom, I adore you!”</p><p>Meri, on the other hand, did not reveal Bonnie Ahlstrom’s cause of death.</p><p>Bonnie’s funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday, March 31, 2021, at the Rocky Ridge Chapel, 157 N.
