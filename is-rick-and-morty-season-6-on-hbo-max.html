While there is no official word on whether the animated series will go on beyond the upcoming seventh season, or indeed when that will come out, those curious to check the show out might have some catching up to do.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Fans who used to watch Rick and Morty but dropped it for a number of different reasons could be thinking about picking it back up now that it is all over the news and in the front of their minds. Others who’ve never even watched it might have a renewed interest for the show, just to be in on the conversation. Most of all, there is a general curiosity to see just what Adult Swim and Cartoon Network do with the show going forward, without one of its leading creatives calling the shots.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>Season six, the last season of Rick and Morty to air, is available to watch on HBO Max, as are all of the show’s other previous seasons. The ten-episode-long season premiered Sept. 4, 2022 and was well received. It ended with a pretty significant cliffhanger, which we will leave unspoiled here for those just watching the show for the first time.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Neither HBO Max nor Hulu</a> — where the show is also available — have expressed any intentions of removing its seasons from their catalog, and with Roiland’s swift dismissal we don’t see that changing in the future. Additionally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming seventh season</a> will count toward the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">70-episode order from Adult Swim made in 2018</a>, prior to season four. With season four, five, and six’s thirty episodes, there are 40 left in the deal between the network and the producers of the show.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>Season seven will need to be deeply reworked now that Roiland won’t be attached, but is still expected to come out some time in 2023, and will likely be available to stream on HBO Max when it does.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yroJyjXZa7pXnMqKmtsV2osqK%2Fzqdkb2Wfo3qprs5mpJqwXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
