Genasis who celebrated their son Ace Flores’ birthday. The little one turned two years old to the absolute joy of his parents who gave him a racing-themed party.</p><p>“Ace Flores, you are everything,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Malika</a> wrote to her son. “Smart, loving, and hilarious,” the celebrity mom shared. “I gave you life and you gave me a reason to live fully and more abundantly,” Malika told her little one. “God blessed the day you were born son. I love you with my entire heart son. Happy 2nd Birthday.”</p><p>O.T. Genasis also took to Instagram with a short yet sweet birthday message to his son. “Happy birthday Ace,” O.T. wrote to his little one. “2years son,” the celebrity father said.</p><p>It seems like just yesterday that <a href=# rel=noopener>Malika Haqq</a> and O.T. Genasis came together to commemorate their son’s first birthday. Ace Flores enjoyed a beautiful bash with his family despite coronavirus restrictions that substantially limited the guest list.</p><p>“Life really began for me a year ago today,” Malika told her social media fans at the time. “You’re my heart outside of my body,” the celebrity mom wrote to her son. “I choose you 1st every day and I’ve gained so much in having you,” Malika continued.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/malika2.jpg alt width=640 height=701 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“Being your mommy has made me so tired yet so happy,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Malika</a> mused. “You’ve taught me true love, commitment, and why prayer is so important,” Haqq shared. “Thank you for giving me purpose daily, strengthening me, maturing me, and most of all making me feel like I’m the most loved mama on this planet. You’re my greatest accomplishment and I’m so honored to raise such a smart, passionate, funny, bright light. My faith is increased because you’re truly God’s love defined. I love you son!”</p><p>Ace Flores is Malika Haqq’s only child. The little one is O.T. Genasis’ youngest son.
