Starring Toby Jones (Empire of Light,&nbsp;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,&nbsp;Sherlock),&nbsp;Mr Bates vs The Post Office&nbsp;chronicles the jaw-dropping plight of hundreds of postal workers accused of a crime they didn’t commit—but went to jail for and worse. It’s a story that UK journalists have reported on for years but once dramatized for TV, set off a firestorm of public outrage that forced the Prime Minister to act. “Toby Jones is perfect in a devastating tale of a national scandal,” says&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>The Guardian</strong></a>&nbsp;(UK).</p><p>Check out the official trailer, learn how and where you can watch, who’s in the cast, the number of episodes, and then tune in to witness how a TV drama triggered justice.</p><li><span class=number>1.</span><h3>What is Mr Bates vs The Post Office About?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/c_mrbates-Get-Ready-ICON-1920x1080-1-1024x576.jpg><p>The drama—based on true and recent events—follows the British Post Office’s unjust prosecution of 700+ of its own local managers for theft and fraud after money seemed to disappear from branches. In truth, the country-wide problem was caused by faulty accounting software installed in the late 1990s; something the highest levels in the Post Office denied for years. Enter real-life hero Alan Bates, the fired postal worker who marshaled his peers and campaigned for decades (and&nbsp;still&nbsp;does) to pursue restitution. What&nbsp;actually&nbsp;happened to these innocents? And how far does Mr Bates get in his crusade?</p><p>Mr Bates vs The Post Office&nbsp;will deeply touch all who relish seeing underdogs championed. It humanely dramatizes “a grave injustice with terrific acting and plan-spoken righteousness,” says&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rotten Tomatoes</strong></a>. “All credit to the [show’s] writer Gwyneth Hughes for the efficiency of her script, which conveyed a mind-boggling scandal clearly and crisply,” says&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>The Times</strong></a>&nbsp;(UK).</p></li><li><span class=number>2.</span><h3>Who’s in the Cast of Mr Bates vs The Post Office</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/c_mrbates-Get-Ready-cast-1920x1080-1-1024x576.jpg><p>Actor Toby Jones portrays the protagonist Alan Bates, an even-tempered everyman who stands up to corporate bullies and won’t back down. Monica Dolan (The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe) is the affable branch manager Jo Hamilton, reduced to deep debt and shame in assuming the accounting software is right and she’s wrong. “Having Jones and Dolan as our entry point to the human cost of such horrifying corporate skullduggery is the perfect choice,” says&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>The Guardian</strong></a>&nbsp;(UK).</p><p>The stellar ensemble cast also includes Julie Hesmondhalgh (The Pact,&nbsp;The Trouble With Maggie Cole), Alex Jennings (The Crown,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Victoria</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Unforgotten</strong></a>), Ian Hart (The Responder), Lia Williams (The Crown,&nbsp;The Capture), Will Mellor (Coronation Street,&nbsp;No Offence), Clare Calbraith (Grace,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Home Fires</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Unforgotten</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Baptiste)</strong></a>, Shaun Dooley (Gentleman Jack,&nbsp;It’s A Sin,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Grantchester</strong></a>), Lesley Nicol (Downton Abbey,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Beecham House</strong></a>), and Katherine Kelly (Bloods,&nbsp;Gentleman Jack), among others.</p></li><li><span class=number>3.</span><h3>What’s the Buzz About Mr Bates vs The Post Office?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mbvpo-key-art-compressed-1920x1080-1-1024x576.jpg><p>The miniseries caused an electrifying stir in Britain when it aired in January 2024; it rattled the public and prompted almost immediate political response. “The dramatization of a real-life British scandal was so effective in portraying a lesser-known miscarriage of justice to the public, that in just a week it moved more than a million people to sign a petition calling for justice for the accused, and prompted the British government to announce a new law,” reports the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>BBC</strong></a>.</p><p>The political drama is also amassing viewers at an astounding rate. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Deadline</strong></a>, it’s the most watched drama in the UK since&nbsp;Line of Duty’s sixth season aired in 2021 on the BBC; the show even beat British broadcaster ITV’s launch of&nbsp;Downton Abbey.</p></li><li><span class=number>4.</span><h3>When will Mr Bates vs The Post Office Air on MASTERPIECE?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/c_mrbates-Get-Ready-airdate-1920x1080-1-1024x576.jpg><p>MASTERPIECE on PBS will broadcast Mr Bates vs The Post Office&nbsp;on Sunday nights at 9/8c<strong> beginning April 7, 2024</strong>.
