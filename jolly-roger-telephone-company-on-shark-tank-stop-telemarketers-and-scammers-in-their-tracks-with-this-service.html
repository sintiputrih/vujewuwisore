It’s a subscription service so once a new customer signs up, they can register which phone numbers they want to protect.</p><p>When an unwanted call comes in, the user can choose to merge that call with one of the Jolly Roger robots.</p><p>For those pesky repeat callers, it’s possible to set up the service so that specific callers are automatically sent to a robot, making this subscription even easier to use.</p><p>Even the robot voices are customizable so those using the service can choose which voices and scripts that they want to use for their unwanted calls. There’s a list of options located on the Jolly Roger Telephone Company website.</p><p>For those who want to see what all the buzz is about, there is a free 30 day trial for the Jolly Roger Telephone Company. After that, access costs just 99 cents per month, per phone line.</p><p>Some of the funniest phone calls recorded by this service have been shared on YouTube and for less than a dollar per month, the service just might be worth it in entertainment value alone.</p><p></p><p>Shark Tank airs on Sundays at 10/9c on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiin6G5unnRqJ6eql2psq2xz6Gmp51dmLyuvMCnsGannmLAqa3RpGStmZ6gerTAzqlkrZ2cmrqivsqeq56qo2Kur7CMrJqapZ2av7R5yKdkraCVnr9uwNGamqSrXay2tbSMrZ%2Biq12osrPCyJycaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
