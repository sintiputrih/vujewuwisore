Olivia Rodrigo‘s debut album is hitting close to home for Anna Marie Tendler following her split from John Mulaney earlier this month.
“Hey bestie, you wanna hang out?” Tendler, 35, captioned an Instagram Story on Monday, May 24, reposting the Sour album announcement.
The artist added: “Listens to this album on repeat all summer.”
The 18-year-old singer’s new album, which hit streaming platforms on Friday, May 21, includes angst-filled songs like “Traitor,” “Happier,” “Brutal,” “Jealousy, Jealousy” and more, seemingly inspired by her own drama with costar and rumored ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
