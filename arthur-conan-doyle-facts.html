At least that left a lot of time for him to indulge his true passion: writing fiction.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Joseph Bell" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/joseph-bell.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>While waiting for patients that never came, Doyle soon created his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes. Although Holmes was such a strange, eccentric figure, he was indeed based on a real person: Doyle's former professor, Dr. Joseph Bell (above).</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Sherlock Holmes" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sherlock-Holmes.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Although the Holmes stories were quickly successful, Doyle was not actually a fan of his most famous literary character. He grew tired of writing about Holmes, desiring instead to write about other topics, like history. "I think of slaying Holmes,... and winding him up for good and all," Doyle wrote his mother in 1891. "He takes my mind from better things."</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Hound Of The Baskervilles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hound-of-the-baskervilles.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>However, when Doyle attempted to free himself of Holmes by killing him off, the outcry from fans was so great that he was forced to bring the character back. His first story back was the acclaimed novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="London House" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/London-House.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Like Holmes, Doyle was a crime fighter himself. In fact, his investigations into closed cases led to the exoneration of two wrongly convicted men.<p>Above: Arthur Conan Doyle's former London home today.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Whaling Ship" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/whaling-ship.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Aside from writing and crime fighting, Doyle worked as a surgeon on a whaling ship in the Arctic. "I went on board the whaler a big straggling youth," he said. "I came off a powerful, well-grown man." This experience was the inspiration for his story "The Captain of the Polestar."</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="Young Arthur Conan Doyle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Young-Doyle.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Long before whaling made him a man, he was born Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, in 1859. Doyle was his sole surname and Conan was a middle name. The reason we so often assume that Conan is part of his surname is that the man himself made that change as an adult.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Charles Doyle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Charles-Doyle.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Doyle’s father, Charles, was an accomplished illustrator, but also a raging alcoholic with mental problems. He was institutionalized for his last 20 years, after stealing from his children and resorting to drinking furniture varnish, among other odd behavior.<p>Above: Self-portrait of Charles Doyle from one of the sketchbooks he owned while at the Royal Montrose Lunatic Asylum in Scotland.</p></span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Licensed To Kill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/licensed-to-kill.jpg> <span class=caption-body>While his father was institutionalized, doyle soldiered on and completed medical school. Unwittingly anticipating James Bond by decades, Doyle sent a cartoon of himself upon graduating medical school to his mother with a caption that drolly read, "Licensed to kill."</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Pinterest</a></span> <img alt="Pastel Reproduction" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pastel-reproduction.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Soon after college, Doyle enjoyed a highly accomplished amateur in golf, boxing, hockey, cricket, and football (under the pseudonym of A.C Smith).</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="1914 Portrait" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1914-Portrait.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Due to his writings about his time spent skiing in Switzerland, Doyle was one of the main people responsible for popularizing the sport in England.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Arthur Conan Doyle Facts Dapper Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dapper-hat.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Doyle did not remain fit in his later years Yet, despite being 40 and overweight, Doyle attempted to volunteer for military service in the Boer War in order to have some adventure. He was deemed unfit to enlist.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Boer War Book" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/boer-war-book.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Instead, he volunteered as a military doctor and set sail for Africa. While there, he wrote a report in support of the war. It was this, and not his famous fiction stories, that caused him to be knighted by King Edward VII in 1902. </span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Winston Chuchill Bowler Hat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/winston-chuchill-bowler-hat.jpg> <span class=caption-body>When World War I broke out, Doyle, then 55, once again attempted to enlist. He was turned down, but, in an attempt to help in some way, did make written suggestions to the War Office stating that they should provide inflatable rubber belts and inflatable life boats as well as body armor to the soldiers. While his ideas were mostly ignored by government officials, Winston Churchill wrote him to thank him for his ideas.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Stamp Face" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/stamp-face.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Doyle even tried to get into government himself. He ran for parliament on two occasions, receiving strong showings, but never winning.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="Speckled Band Python" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/speckled-band-python.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In addition to running for office, he occupied himself, when not writing, with stage productions of his work. When mounting a production of the classic Holmes tale "The Adventure of the Speckled Band," Doyle insisted over the actors' protests that the story's culprit, a python, be played by a live snake. After several onstage mishaps, Doyle relented, an artificial snake was brought in, and the play went on to do quite well.<p>Image Sources: <a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a> (left), <a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a> (right)</p></span><img alt="Family Photo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Family-photo.jpg> <span class=caption-body>While Holmes-related work, whether in print or on stage, was always received well by the public, Doyle published many unrelated novels, pamphlets, poems, and short stories that have been largely lost to history.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Cottingley Faeries" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cottingley-faeries.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Some of his non-Holmes writings that have retained public interest have to do with Doyle's spiritualism. Throughout much of his later life, the writer was a strong believer in the paranormal, including telepathy, mediums, and psychics. He also believed that faeries existed, and wrote about the Cottingley Fairies (above), a well-known series of photographs that have since been deemed a hoax.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="Houdini Portrait" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Houdini-portrait.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Doyle's spiritualism led him into a friendship with famous illusionist Harry Houdini (above). They were fast friends at the beginning, but things began to sour when Houdini went about debunking spiritualists. Houdini later showed Doyle how the spiritualists used illusions to trick the public, but Doyle insisted that Houdini was really a spiritualist that denied his own gift.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></span> <img alt="Newspaper Obituary" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/newspaper-obituary.jpg> <span class=caption-body>After devoting much of his last years to spiritualism, Doyle died in rather dramatic fashion. He took his last breath in his garden on July 7, 1930, holding a flower in one hand, and clutching his heart with the other. His last words were to his wife: “You are wonderful."</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="Spiritualist Portrait" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/spiritualist-portrait.jpg> <span class=caption-body>After his death, a grand séance was held at Royal Albert Hall to try and contact his spirit. Though he did not appear, many in the audience claim to have felt his presence that night.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span><p>Next, meet <a href=#>Alice Clement</a>, the real-life, female Sherlock Holmes.
