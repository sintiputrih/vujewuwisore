Alongside Bruce Willis as Detective David Addison, the show also starred Cybill Shepherd&nbsp;as Madolyn “Maddie” Hayes. It also featured Allyce Beasley&nbsp;as Agnes DiPesto, and Revenge of the Nerd‘s Curtis Armstrong&nbsp;as Herbert Viola. The series revolves around the adventures of Shepherd, a former model, and Willis, a detective, as they run a private detective agency and solve intriguing cases.</p><p>During its 67-episode run, the critically acclaimed Moonlighting garnered multiple prestigious accolades. These include Golden Globe Awards, People’s Choice Awards, and Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Notably, in 1987, Bruce achieved a significant milestone. He won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

In particular, Rumer sees flashes of her dad from Moonlighting.</p><p>“Whenever she’s got a stern discerning look on her face, I just see&nbsp;Bruce Willis,” she explained. “My dad — especially on&nbsp;Moonlighting&nbsp;— has this little side smirk, that very [mischievous] twinkle in his eye, and I see that so much in her.”</p><p>“[Louetta] is truly the joy of my life and my little best friend, and I’ve never had anything happen to me that’s brought me greater joy,” Rumer said</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51kvaa7z6WcaJqiqrCmedaio6Who2KzornIpbBmnZOowaLAyJxknKSRqMCqr4ytrWarmKTEbrnOqKWloZedwaq6xmalqK9dqMGzscCmoKefXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
