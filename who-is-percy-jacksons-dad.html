Recommended Videos Percy Jackson and the Olympians has already hit Disney Plus, and it’s ready to take our mortal world by storm.
Focusing on the journey of a young demigod named Percy (Walker Scobell), Rick Riordan’s story is one filled with myth and fantastical, captivating characters. It only makes sense, then, for the TV show to be made of the same stuff, serving as a faithful adaptation of the beloved book series."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One of the most important ones, though, pertains to his father. I mean, it’s not every day that one finds out their dad is a god, so it’s only natural to want to know which one.</p><h2 id=h-which-god-is-percy-jackson-s-father data-injectable=false>Which god is Percy Jackson’s father?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/riptide.png><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Percy Jackson’s father is Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology. This revelation comes fairly early into the series, when Percy is claimed as Poseidon’s son, but it takes a bit longer for the boy to meet his dad in person. Rest assured, though, they meet face-to-face in the first book, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lightning Thief</a>, and then on several occasions throughout the series.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=false>That said, Poseidon is not a main character in the story, and his appearances tend to be quick. Despite his absence throughout most of his son’s life, though, the god does hold affection for Percy and claims that he is the favorite among his children. Why did Poseiden abandon Percy, then? Well, that’s part of a completely different conversation, but trust that he had his motives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxloJq%2FpMWMo5ico6Oku7R5w5qbaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
