WWE has a history of changing Superstars names when they enter the company, even if they are already established. This has been true for a lot of Superstars over the years, because the company wants names that they can own and trademark."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The word around the Performance Center at this time is that the new Lexis King name will be given to the former AEW star.</p><p>“WWE trademarked a ring name for Lexis King. We have heard around the WWE Performance Center that this name was earmarked for Brian Pillman Jr.”</p><p>This new name would make a bit of sense. It was noted that Lexis would be short for Alexis, Brian Pillman’s half-sister who tragically passed away in a car accident. Also, King is the last name of Brian Pillman Jr’s mother, Melanie. It seems to add up, so we will have to see what happens.</p><p><a href=#>Click here to check out the latest teaser that WWE NXT released for Brian Pillman Jr’s debut</a>. No name was noted in the vignette, but ties to Pillman were obvious.</p><p>Brian Pillman Jr. had a lot of eyes on him in AEW, where he was 1/2 of the Varsity Blondes. That team is no longer a thing, as Griff Garrison is not coming with Pillman to NXT. It seems that Pillman’s name isn’t going with him, either.</p><p>What’s your take on WWE changing up Brian Pillman Jr.’ s name?
