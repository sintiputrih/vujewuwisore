Margot Robbie opened up in a new interview about her “awkward” first-ever sex scene, which she filmed for The Wolf of Wall Street. The 26-year-old actress, who played Naomi Lapaglia in the film, stripped down for that infamous graphic scene where she pushes away Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort with her high heel in the baby’s playroom.
“I hadn’t done a proper sex scene before,” she told Vanity Fair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That was my first.”</p><p>There’s really no way to prepare for the onscreen romp, Robbie said, except to act confident and go for it. “Tons of people are watching you,” she told the magazine. “There isn’t an option. It’s just like, ‘This is what you need to do — get on with it.’ The sooner you do it, the sooner you can stop doing it,” she said, adding that it was “so awkward.”</p><p><span>One thing she did prep for, though, while shooting <i>Wolf of Wall Street</i>: the thick Brooklyn accent. The Australian beauty worked with dialect coach Tim Monich, but she already had a foundation because she had spent two years trying to perfect the American accent. “Two years learning about the muscles in your mouth and bone structures and resonators and all that,” she said.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/margot-robbie-leo-wolf-of-wall-street-zoom-eebaf484-8238-4477-b32f-5538608cacd7.jpg><p>Before she landed her breakout role in the finance film, Robbie grew up Down Under and started acting in high school. “When I was little, I thought I was going to be a magician. I had tricks and thought they were genius,” she told the magazine. “I did drama at school and was in all the plays just because I liked doing it.”</p><p>Eventually, she nabbed a part on the Australian soap opera <i>Neighbours</i> by calling the show’s production company daily. “I’d sit in the makeup chair and have 60 pages to memorize because my character spoke so much,” she said. “She was the one that would walk in and be a whirlwind. … We did an episode a day. In film terms, that’s insane. It was amazing training.”</p><p><span>Robbie also recalled her perception of the United States and Hollywood as an outsider. “I remember watching American movies and TV shows growing up and thinking, Oh, God, these crazy characters doing these outlandish things, how do the writers come up with it? Then I moved to America and met so many people just like the people in the movies, and I realized, Oh, so this is just real life in America.”</span></p><span class=caption></span><p>All this paved the way for Robbie to land starring roles as Jane in <i>The Legend of Tarzan </i>and Harley Quinn in <i>Suicide Squad</i>. Now the beauty lives in a shared London apartment with two nonfamous friends and her boyfriend, <b>Tom Ackerley</b>, whom she met while shooting <i>Suite Française</i>. The four roommates formed a production company together, LuckyChap Entertainment, which is&nbsp; developing several projects for Robbie, including the <b>Tonya Harding </b>story in which she will star as the disgraced figure skater.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKcvLV50aiZm6GVYsGiuMqsZJqvm6yus7CMsKalnl2ks27DwKWjZqukp7KmwIysnLFlo5iyr7HSZq5raWJng3Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
