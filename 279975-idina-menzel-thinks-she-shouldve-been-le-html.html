The Broadway star, who was only 39 at the time of her appearance, did not feel like she completely fit her role.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Menzel portrayed the role of Shelby Cocoran, Rachel Berry's biological mom and rival coach to an opposing glee club. Although Shelby was introduced as a young surrogate in need, the role felt a bit too old for Menzel.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>At the time of Menzel’s first appearance on the popular singing show in 2010, Michele, who played Rachel Berry, was 26. Of course, she played a high school student on the show, but the age gap was not lost on Menzel.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The actress revealed that although she was thrilled to be on the show, her self-esteem was a little affected by portraying Michele’s mother. She felt this way, especially because of the slight difference in her and Michele’s age.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Nonetheless, Menzel recalls having a fantastic time working with everyone involved in the show. Thankfully, she also clarified that she’s since gotten over it while <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instyle.com/politics-social-issues/badass-women/idina-menzel-badass-questionnaire-video>speaking</a> on her recurring role recently:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>“She was 26, and I probably should’ve been her older sister, but I don’t have a chip on my shoulder about that.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In 2016, Menzel explored the same topic concerning where she was in life at the time. She had just given birth to her son with ex-husband Taye Diggs and added that the maternal role to someone near her age bruised her ego.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Menzel also <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/article/2016/04/19/tribeca-film-festival-2016-idina-menzel/>explained</a> she was dealing with not feeling like she was at her best weight at the time as well. However, she could still reflect on the moment as bittersweet and admitted she had to get over herself.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Lea Michele as Rachel and guest star Idina Menzel as her mother in the "Sweet Dreams" episode of "Glee," March 2013 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In addition to recalling how her role as Shelby made her feel, <a class="ae -U" href=#>Menzel</a> reflected on some of her favorite moments on set.
