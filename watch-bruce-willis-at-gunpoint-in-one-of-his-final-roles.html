Recommended Videos Late career Willis has seen him doing lesser and smaller profile movies which seem to only exist to pad his pocket. Which is fine, he’s an actor and he has to earn a living, but it’s hard to see the actor who played the legendary John McClane reduced to a mere caricature of himself."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, he will be appearing in the limited release movie Wrong Place coming out later this month.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>An exclusive clip from the movie actually showcases classic Willis: a man with a gun in a standoff with a hostage. The movie involves Willis as a small-time police chief who’s being hunted by a meth cook so he won’t testify against him. The meth cook quickly figures out that Willis isn’t the type of guy you want to go after.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>In the clip, Willis is searching through a wooded area and comes across his daughter (Ashley Greene), who quickly starts apologizing after the meth cook appears. The cook, played by Michael Sirow, wastes no time and holds the daughter at gunpoint.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>If we’re being honest, Willis recites his lines with the same enthusiasm one would save for ordering Chinese food, but it is nice to see him holding a gun, if only for the nostalgia aspect of it. And, this could very well be Willis’s last time starring in a movie.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Wrong Place will release on July 15.
