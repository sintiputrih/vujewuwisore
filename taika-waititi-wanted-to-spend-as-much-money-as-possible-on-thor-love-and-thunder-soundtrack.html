Recommended Videos From the instant we discerned Guns N’ Roses’ “Sweet Child O’ Mine” in the background of Love and Thunder‘s first trailer, we knew music was going to play a big role in the film, which was confirmed by Waititi in an interview with Vital Thrills."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s always been a dream of mine. The whole aesthetic around the film was always we wanted it to be this bombastic, loud, colorful palette, which kind of reflected, like, spray painted panel vans in the ’80s and rock album covers.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, Waititi spoke about hard rock influences like Metallica and Guns N’ Roses during the MCU blockbuster’s press conference, which are held close to the writer and director’s heart.</p><p>“Even the title treatment, you know, for the film, it’s the kind of thing I would’ve drawn on my school book in class when I wasn’t listening. I remember spending months and months perfecting the Metallica logo at school. So yeah, and just to tap into all that stuff and Guns N’ Roses, was like one of my all-time favorite bands. To be able to use that stuff to reflect the sort of crazy adventure that we’re presenting visually was another one of my dreams that came true.”</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>The cost to license a popular song for a movie is not light. Varsity Blues <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paid $500,000</a> to use AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” for a single scene. Guns N’ Roses licensing fees are likely of similar heft, although lead singer Axl Rose once <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gave “Sweet Child O’ Mine” to the The Wrestler for free.</a></p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=false>We doubt Rose was that generous for Thor: Love and Thunder, but thankfully Waititi was, or we wouldn’t have the Thor/GN’R crossover that we didn’t know we needed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq5qhm5Z6uK3IraCtoV2srq%2FAxJ1kraddqL2musNmmKxlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2WwG68zqyqopqcmnqwuoytn6iqXaG8t7GMmqWdZaSdwq%2BwxKtkrKelo7G1vsCcomg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
