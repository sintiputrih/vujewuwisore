His musical style is primarily defined as Latin trap and Reggaeton, although his music also incorporates various other elements from other genres. He first rose to fame in 2016 with his debut album "X 100pre" and quickly established himself as one of the most popular Latin American artists of his generation. Bad Bunny is credited with helping Spanish-language music achieve mainstream popularity in the worldwide market. In 2020, he became the first non-English language act to be Spotify's most streamed artist of the year and achieved the same record again in 2021. He then had the biggest streaming year for any artist on Spotify in 2022. In February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez. Bad Bunny has earned three Grammy Awards, four Latin Grammy Awards, eight Billboard Music Awards, and thirteen Lo Nuestro Awards. He was crowned Artist of the Year at the Apple Music Awards 2022. He collaborated with many artists including Drake, Daddy Yankee, and ROSALÍA. He also released an album Oasis collaboratively with J Balvin. In addition to his successful music career, Bad Bunny is known for his fashion sense and his philanthropic work, including his support of the LGBTQ+ community and his advocacy for mental health awareness. His stage name originally came from a time in which he was forced to wear a bunny costume and was angry about it.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikqae2pLLLrpynrF6YvK57y56qrKeeqHyjrcOYma6mnq6sqbXBoqKil52kv6KrxKeepaGjnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
