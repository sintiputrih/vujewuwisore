Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood defeated The Gunns to win the AEW World Tag Team Championship in a Titles vs. AEW Careers match on the April 5 episode of AEW Dynamite. In doing so, they seemingly confirmed their decision to stay with AEW, as their contracts were coming up.

The stadium show is a major step for AEW, and FTR has a buzzworthy match in mind for ir.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Raj Prashad of </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uproxx</a>, Hatwood stated that a trios match where <a href=#>CM Punk</a> and FTR would take on The Elite could help AEW sell 50,000 tickets for the show and reach the next level.</p><p>“CM Punk and FTR versus the Elite,” Harwood said. “That’s gotta be it, right? If you want to sell 50,000 tickets and take this company to the next level, that’s it, that’s me dreaming. That’s the dream match. That six-man tag in Wembley Stadium could help launch AEW to the next level.”</p><p>Wheeler shared his thoughts on AEW booking Wembley Stadium in the first place and emphasized the importance of the move. He highlighted the ambition of AEW CEO Tony Khan and the way that the company keeps proving doubters wrong.</p><p>“Wembley Stadium is huge for AEW,” Wheeler continues. “AEW has to be ambitious right now. We’ve done so much as a company over the past three years that everybody said we couldn’t do. When Tony said we’re going to sell 20,000 (tickets at Arthur Ashe Stadium), that seemed ridiculous to people at the time.”</p><p>“Everybody wants to keep moving the goalposts. Everybody wants to keep saying you can’t do this. I love that we’re going to Wembley because even if it’s not completely to the brim full, 50-, 60-, 70,000, whatever it ends up being, that’s huge for this company. As a company that’s only a couple years into its existence. You can’t play it safe all the time. The roster right now is so deep, why not go for it?”</p><p>Punk has been absent from AEW since the aftermath of AEW All Out 2022; after he won the world title in the main event, he made heated comments about The Elite at the post-show media scrum, which led to a brawl between the two sides. Everyone involved was suspended, and while The Elite returned in November, Punk has remained absent. Punk tore his triceps during the pay-per-view match, but a <a href=#>recent report</a> indicated that he could be cleared to compete soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJva29oYWKztb6MrZ%2BeZZWhtrWxjK%2BqZpudYr22uspmmKecXZvBs3nCqKylnF2dsq28jK2YpJ1dlrK4edOoZK2glWK7psTTZqOerpWh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
