Find out more and what Tammy has been up to all these while in this ‘Tammy Knickerbocker Bio’.</p><h3><strong>Where Is RHOC’s Tammy Knickerbocker Now?</strong></h3><p>Tammy Knickerbocker, joined the cast of RHOC as a single mother of three in Season 2 (2007) at the recommendation of her close friend then-Housewife Jeana Keough.</p><p>She was only a full-time Housewife during seasons 2 and 3 and appeared as a guest during seasons 4, 5, 6, and 10.</p><p>After taking a step back from the show, she relocated to Balboa Island in Newport Beach, California. In April 2014, she told Yahoo TV that she continues to co-parent with Duff Evans, the father of her youngest son, Ryley.</p><p>Speaking of her relationship status in recent times, it reads ‘single’ on Facebook. She indeed seemed to be dating no one and rather focused on this new venture than she launched (in January 2022) with her daughter <a href=#>Megan Knickerbocker</a>.</p><p>Together with her family, Tammy continued living in Newport Beach.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Tammy Knickerbocker Kids?</strong></h3><p>Tammy Knickerbocker as you know has three kids: daughters <a href=#>Lindsey</a>, <a href=#>Megan</a>, and the youngest son Ryley.</p><p>The last time we checked Lindsey was still listed as an inmate on Crittenden’s jail roster. She was 33 years old as of the incident. (Tammy had her at 25.)</p><p>Then, there’s Megan who turned 35 in June 2021.</p><p>Megan is believed to be a very hardworking individual. She was going to school to become a nurse. At the same time, she also assisted her mother and her sister to launch their marketing company “Veriya”.</p><p>Riley also seemed to be all grown up now. He is Lindsey and Megan’s half-brother. But they pamper him and adore him nonetheless.</p><p>The family especially gets a lot that Riley looks exactly like Tammy. This, even Duff Evans admits. (Duff is Riley’s dad and Lindsey and Megan’s stepdad.)</p><h3><strong>Tammy Knickerbocker Ex-Husband</strong></h3><p>Lindsey and Megan’s dad is Tammy’s late ex-husband Louis L. Knickerbocker who passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 67 back in April 2007.</p><p>Before he died, late Louis also found fame on RHOC as Tammy’s ex-husband. The fallout of his life was replayed on the reality show. Fans had learned the company he and then-wife Tammy owned had gone bankrupt in 2000. The couple had lost their 9,000-square-foot home in Coto de Caza, and Tammy had divorced him.</p><p>Louis, aka Lou, had then started his life over at 62, building a real estate company, a mortgage company, and a 50 percent share in another real estate company. He also got married to Netdao.</p><p>A Reddit thread created following his death dished how all his money ended up with his “Thai wife” while Tammy and her daughters were left with none.</p><p>The discussion was led to the conclusion that because Louis had no written will so his wife got what was left (which was a house and some cash) and that his daughters never sued the wife for their share because there was not anything/much left.</p><h3><strong>Tammy Knickerbocker And Duff’s Relationship</strong></h3><p>Duff Evans, other than being Riley’s dad, is Tammy Knickerbocker’s former boyfriend. Yes. they never got engaged or married.</p><p>They were already separated by the time Riley was five and in kindergarten, or even before that.</p><p>Sometime after Tammy, Duff dated another RHOC fellow Shannon Storms Beador. But, things did not work out between these two, either. Shannon eventually met John Janssen was dating him around December 2019.</p><p>Anyway, over the years, Tammy and Duff seemed to have done a good enough co-parenting job.</p><p>“Duff Evans and I live down the street from each other. We always surprise people when they realize we’re not a couple still. I always kid with them and say the secret to our relationship is we date other people”, Tammy had gushed in a previously talked-about interview with Yahoo TV (in 2014).</p><p>Then in June 2020, we spotted them proudly talking about their son Riley, over Facebook. “I just ran into our friend Gonzalo Alonzo today and he looked at Ryley and said oh my God it’s Tammy”, Duff had commented.</p><h3><strong>Tammy Knickerbocker Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Tammy Knickerbocker reportedly possessed $700 thousand as net worth by February 2022.</p><p>Earlier in January 2022, Tammy took to her social media to announce that she and her daughter Megan had started their new company “Knickerbocker Beauty”.</p><p>By the look of it, their marketing company, that negotiated product placement in feature films, television, and reality TV shows, was no longer functioning.</p><h3><strong>Tammy Knickerbocker Height</strong></h3><p>Tammy Knickerbocker stands below 5’6” tall.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Tammy Knickerbocker?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Because Tammy was born on 17 July 1963, she turned 58 in 2021.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Tammy Knickerbocker Maiden Name?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tammy likely went around as Tammy Wilsey (her maiden name) before getting married to Louis.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Tammy Knickerbocker On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tammy Knickerbocker could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@itsallbling</a>. But she seemed less active on it as of 23 February 2022 as compared to her Facebook handle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrZmdosZut82imqSdope8pLfEq2SboZ9iu7DDjKSgnatdmcKnsoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMq5%2Bom18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
