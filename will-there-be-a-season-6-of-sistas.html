Do they always have the best taste in men that aren't walking red flags? Not always, but no matter what life throws their way, the leading ladies of Sistas always have each others backs.</p><p>So, has BET renewed Sistas for Season 6 yet?

So, more than likely, Sistas will return for a sixth season.</p><p>Even better? The official has the full first episode of Sistas Season 5 available to watch on their channel — for free!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How can you stream all five seasons of 'Sistas'?</h2><p>We know what you're thinking — how can you binge-watch all five seasons of Sistas after checking out the free episode on the BET YouTube channel?</p><p>The best way to access every single episode so far of Sistas is with a subscription to BET's streaming service, <a href=#>BET Plus</a>. New subscribers can even sign up for a seven-day free trial (so now you don't have an excuse not to watch Sistas!)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>You can purchase individual episodes of Sistas on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Video</a> as well for $2.99 per episode (or $14.99 for a full season).</p><p>Another good sign for the series is the fact that there has historically been a quick turnaround time between seasons. So, if Sistas does return for a sixth season, fans likely won't have to wait a whole year for new episodes.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>If you're already caught up on Sistas, make sure to tune in for the Sistas Season 5 finale on March 15 on BET at 9 p.m. EST. You can also stream the Sistas Season 5 finale episode after it airs live on BET Plus.</p><p>And we have a feeling we'll be talking about Sistas Season 6 sooner rather than later!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIytn56qlWKvpnnAZqqemaOku26CjKidZquZqMGivw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
