Welcome to Day #6 in my 12 Days of Christmas Cookies! This has been the most fun challenge for me and the amount of baking that has gone down in my kitchen is unreal! I am giving away cookie right and left.
I wanted to create a few gourmet Christmas cookies that will really impress."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I am giving away cookie right and left.</p><p>I wanted to create a few gourmet Christmas cookies that will really impress. These Chocolate Caramel Turtle Cookies have it all — rich decadent chocolatey flavor, the sweet and buttery flavor from the caramel, and the nutty crunch from the pecans. This is definitely a luxurious Christmas cookie!</p><p>This may sound more complicated than it really is. It starts off with a soft, chewy chocolate cookie, rolled in chopped pecans and baked.

If using salted butter, reduce the salt by 1/4 teaspoon.</li><li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> — this recipe calls for light brown sugar and it helps to create chewy chocolate cookies.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — this recipe calls for granulated sugar.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong> — use large-sized eggs.</li><li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> — use pure vanilla extract. I suggest <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B000GAWH4G data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Extract</a> or <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0013ABIXY data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Real Mexcian Vanilla</a>.</li><li><strong>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder</strong> — this is unsweetened baking cocoa found in the baking aisle. I buy the Callebaut cocoa powder at Winco in their bulk bin section.</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — this recipe calls for all-purpose flour.</li><li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> — this is what adds the perfect soft texture and thickens the cookie without turning them cakey.</li><li><strong>Baking Soda</strong> — this is what helps the cookies to rise once they hit the oven to bake.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> — this is the flavor enhancer and an integral ingredient in baking.</li></ul><p><strong>Topping:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Caramel Dip or Dulce de Leche</strong> — this needs to be a thick caramel, not a runny caramel sauce. I like to use caramel dip (found in the produce section of the grocery store) because of its thickness.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pecans</strong> — use chopped pecans to roll the chocolate cookie dough in before baking.</li><li><strong>Milk Chocolate Chips</strong> — use either milk chocolate chips (my favorite milk chocolate baking chips are Guittard) or a milk chocolate bar.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Chocolate-Caramel-Pecan-Turtle-Cookies-11-720x700.jpg alt="Chocolate Caramel Pecan Turtle Cookies made with a chewy chocolate cookie rolled in pecans and topped with caramel and melted chocolate.

Add eggs and vanilla extract.</li><li><strong>Fold in cocoa powder, flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt</strong>. Don’t overmix or it will create too much gluten, which will create a tough cookie.</li><li><strong>Scoop out the cookie dough and roll into balls</strong>. These cookies can be made small, medium, large, or extra-large! I would say if you want an extra-large cookie, you want to roll it into 6-ounce balls. A large cookie would be 4.5-5 ounces. A medium cookie would be about 3 ounces. A small cookie of about two ounces. I suggest making them about 2.5 – 3 ounces.</li><li><strong>Roll the sides of the cookie dough balls into chopped pecans</strong> and place on a light-colored baking sheet (may be lined with parchment paper). Gently press down on the cookie dough balls to slightly flatten them.</li><li><strong>Bake for about 9-11 minutes</strong>. Be careful not to overbake these cookies. Set aside to cool.</li><li><strong>Once the cookies have cooled</strong>, carefully top each cookie with caramel dip, and spread it all over the cookie.</li><li><strong>Melt the milk chocolate</strong> in the microwave on half power or in a double boiler. Drizzle the top with the melted chocolate. May sprinkle with extra pecans, if so desired.</li><li><strong>Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes</strong> to allow the caramel and milk chocolate to set up.&nbsp;</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Chocolate-Caramel-Pecan-Turtle-Cookies-20-720x690.jpg alt="Chocolate Caramel Pecan Turtle Cookies made with a chewy chocolate cookie rolled in pecans and topped with caramel and melted chocolate.
