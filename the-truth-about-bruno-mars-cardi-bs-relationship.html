They're more than just Atlantic Records label mates: they're creative powerhouses, and they have a lot of respect for each other as fellow performers. The two linked up for the first time in 2018 for Mars' remix of "Finesse" from the multiple Grammy-winning <a href=#>24k Magic</a> album and a year later for the rapper's "Please Me" flirtatious hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Ellen DeGeneres Has Done Since Getting Canceled</a></span></p><p>So, how did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their wholesome friendship start</a>? Is it true that Cardi B once had to cancel her show with Bruno Mars due to her pregnancy? Who made the first move, and what's next two of the biggest music stars?</p><h2 id=their-friendship-started-on-social-media><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Their Friendship Started On Social Media</span></h2><p>Neither Cardi B nor Bruno have spoken about how their friendship sparked. However, back in 2017, a fan asked the R&B star about who's the current new-school artist he had been listening to, to which he replied, "Cardi B." Of course, when someone as big as Bruno Mars co-signs you on Twitter, things don't go unnoticed. She later took to Instagram in a now-deleted post about the Twitter exchange, "This is soooo crazy. Can't believe he even knows me @brunomars soooo Dope !!!!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fast-forward-a-year-later-the-two-collaborated-on-39-finesse---remix-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Fast Forward A Year Later, The Two Collaborated On 'Finesse - Remix'</span></h2><p>Not too long after that, the two linked up creatively for the remix version of "Finesse," the funky jam from Bruno Mars' 24k Magic album. The two pay tribute to the classic '90s In Living Color comedy sketch show for the hit's accompanying music video. The two seem to share matching chemistry and have a lot of fun during the video's shoot, which accumulates to a whopping 750 million views on YouTube up to this writing!</p><h2 id=the-song-amassed-a-plethora-of-accolades><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Song Amassed A Plethora Of Accolades</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of those fantastic numbers of YouTube views, "Finesse" was nominated for several awards, including the MTV VMAs for Best Collaboration and Billboard Music Awards for Top R&B Song. It landed the two powerhouse creatives an America Music Awards win for Favorite Song - Soul/R&B and iHeartRadio'sTitanium Awards.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything B.o.B.

First, the powerhouse singer won all the six categories he was nominated for, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year. Second, he shared the stage with Cardi B to perform the remix rendition of "Finesse" in a very colorful In Living Color-inspired performance. Cardi entered the arena in a color-blocked outfit for her verse before Bruno and his Hooligans band joined her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bruno-mars-has-always-spoken-highly-of-her><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bruno Mars Has Always Spoken Highly Of Her</span></h2><p>That said, Mars has always spoken highly of the rapper. In an Instagram post, the singer reminisced the time he met Cardi B to record her verse for "Finesse" for the first time. "I met Cardi B at 3 am after my show in LA backstage where we recorded her verse for Finesse," he wrote, offering some words of encouragement. "She walked in the room and she was everything I’d hope she’d be. Never change Cardi! Don’t let this crazy music business change who you are."</p><h2 id=she-had-to-cancel-her-39-24k-magic-world-tour-39-with-bruno-mars-due-to-pregnancy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Had To Cancel Her '24k Magic World Tour' With Bruno Mars Due To Pregnancy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two were even scheduled to perform together during the second American leg of Mars' 24k Magic World Tour in 2018. Unfortunately, the rapper had to withdraw herself from the show to raise her newborn baby at the time. She was later replaced by the likes of Boyz II Men, Ciara, Ella Mai, and Charlie Wilson. "Thank you Bruno for being so supportive and understanding," she took to social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Musicians Who Started Out With Completely Different Careers</a></span></p><h2 id=this-didn-39-t-stop-their-creative-collaboration><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>This Didn't Stop Their Creative Collaboration</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year later, Cardi B ended her two-year retirement, the two linked up again and got steamy for "Please Me," a silky-smooth R&B jam about temptation. It's brutally teasing, and it takes you back to the old 1990s R&B stylings. The triple-platinum song itself topped charts in several countries, making 2019 another legendary year for Mars and Cardi.</p><h2 id=39-please-me-39-was-nominated-for-several-awards><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'Please Me' Was Nominated For Several Awards</span></h2><p>Speaking of accolades, "Please Me" landed the two superstars another awarding night win. Besides the BET Awards' nomination for Best Collaboration, "Please Me" received two trophies from ASCAP for Pop Music and R&B. In the very same year, Cardi scored her first-ever Grammy triumph for Best Rap Album thanks to her debut Invasion of Privacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-year-the-two-creative-powerhouses-were-battling-for-1-spot><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>This Year, The Two Creative Powerhouses Were Battling For #1 Spot</span></h2><p>Now, although the pair have gone on their separate ways (Bruno Mars is busy building his Silk Sonic super duo with Anderson .Paak and Cardi B is gearing up for her sophomore album), they are still competing healthily on the charts. This year, Mars' Silk Sonic duo fought to top the chart with their lead single "Leave the Door Open" against Cardi B's "Up" and Olivia Rodrigo's "Drivers License." Either way, we're still dying to hear another Mars x Cardi combo, and hopefully, there will be more to come!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Reason Why Bruno Mars Changed His Name</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6o77Up6ZmpZGnwG6vwKubomWSqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
