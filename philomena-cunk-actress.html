For her performance in Cunk on Shakespeare, Diane received a BAFTA nomination for Best Female Performance in a Comedy Programme.</p><p>Diane first appeared as the dim-witted host in a regular segment on Charlie Brooker's Weekly Wipe from 2013 to 2015. In May 2020, she returned to the show in a one-off episode titled "Antiviral Wipe," all about the COVID-19 pandemic. As we all know, Diane currently stars as Philomena in Cunk on Earth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Now, despite being best known for the ridiculous character known as Philomena Cunk, Diane has been in the entertainment industry for years. She has plenty of other credits to her name — check them out below!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Diane Morgan is best known for Philomena, but she has other credits to her name.</h2><p>Sure, she's made a name for herself as Philomena Cunk; however, Diane has been popping up in the scene since 2002.</p><p>Diane has appeared in various British sitcoms, such as Phoenix Nights, The Royal Bodyguard, The Work Experience, Him & Her, and Motherland. The actress has also been in a few feature films, including the 2016 romantic drama <a href=#>Me Before You</a> and the Netflix mockumentaries <a href=#>Death to 2020</a> and Death to 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Diane poses with her 'After Life' costars after winning Best Comedy at the 2022 National Television Awards.</p></figure><p>Perhaps her most well-known role besides Philomena Cunk is Kath in the Netflix black comedy-drama series After Life. In the Netflix series, which concluded in January 2022, Kath is Tony's (<a href=#>Ricky Gervais</a>) co-worker who sells ads for the newspaper and frequently complains about being single — Wow, talk about relatable.</p><p>Since July 2019, Diane has been starring in Mandy, a BBC sitcom about the unemployed eponymous character trying to navigate life. The 47-year-old actress stars as the title character and also writes and directs the series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: BBC</span><p>Diane Morgan as Mandy Carter in 'Mandy'</p></figure><p>In August 2022, Diane spoke about the series with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, stating that her experiences with stand-up comedy prepared her to write a sitcom "because when you're on stage, obviously, you need to get to the funny bit as quickly as possible before people start throwing things at you."</p><p>She added that directs the show out of convenience: "If I'd have employed a director, I would have had to say, 'Right, I'd like this' and try to describe what's in my head, which is almost like making it more difficult than just doing it yourself."</p><p>Cunk on Earth is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbWquM6mnKeZXZjCr7eMmpqtqpWowA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
