Even though the As Good As It Gets actress has “kept the romance quiet,” the adorable lovebirds are “going strong,” the insider reveals.</p><p>Helen has a new man in her life, but that doesn’t mean she’s any less focused on coparenting with her ex-boyfriend, Matthew. In fact, raising her little girl with the House of Lies writer, 59 — whom she dated from 2001 to 2017 — is “still [Helen’s] top priority,” the source dishes.</p><p>“Even though she and Matthew don’t always see eye to eye,” the insider adds. “Matthew has also been dating someone, so everyone seems to have moved on and they’re all happy … especially Makena.”</p><p>Earlier in December, Closer exclusively revealed <a href=#>Helen was officially off the market</a> and dating the professional photographer. “Helen and Steven are definitely an item,” a separate insider shared. “She’s really into him and hopes it works out, that’s why she’s not going public with it just yet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/helen-hunts-daughter-makena-loves-steven-tepper-romance02.jpg><p>Steven is a “super private” and “regular guy,” the source noted, so Helen — who was married to her only husband, <strong>Hank Azaria</strong>, from 1999 to 2000 — is in no rush to divulge the details of their romance. “She doesn’t want to overwhelm him with the celebrity spotlight,” the insider explained.</p><p>Fortunately, the most important people in Helen’s life already accept her new relationship with Steven, including her teenage daughter. “Makena likes him and that goes a long way in her book,” the source said. “[Helen] deserves happiness and Steven makes her happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hnKWdnmK1trrTrGSdmaWctbWx0WakmqOVo65uuM6vnKxlo6myt7HNZqueqKCav26%2BzqaYp5uVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
