He has mainly gamed the TaylorMade M2 and TaylorMade Stealth Plus drivers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The TaylorMade M2 Driver&nbsp; is further enhanced by a multi-material construction that combines a Speed Pocket, Geocoustic Internal Geometry, and Carbon crown. It also pairs up with a 9-degree loft set and comes spaced at 45.75 inches long, offering Woods the perfect balance of distance and forgiveness out on the course.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, the TaylorMade Stealth Plus driver features an adjustable sole weight, a 9-degree loft, and a 45.75-inch length shaft, providing Woods with added control and distance.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Compelled Tiger Woods to Choose TaylorMade</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tiger has chosen the TaylorMade drivers because of their state-of-the-art technology, which will provide him with much longer, higher-flying, and accurate tee-balls, something he desires to compete at a high level.
