The duo got engaged in January 2015 and secretly tied the knot that August. They welcomed their now 4-year-old daughter, Elsie Otter, in 2015 and their 3-year-old son, Charlie Wolf, in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zooey-Deschanel-Finalizes-Divorce-From-Jacob-Pechenik.jpg><p>Us confirmed in September 2019 that the former pair announced that <a href=#>they had called it quits after four years of marriage</a>. In a joint statement, Deschanel and Pechenik said they reached the decision to separate “after much discussion and a long period of contemplation.”</p><p>“We have decided we are better off as friends, business partners and co-parents rather than life partners,” the statement continued. “We remain committed to our business, our values and most of all our children.”</p><p>The 500 Days of Summer actress’ former husband <a href=#>filed for divorce in Los Angeles in October 2019</a>. Their date of separation was listed as January 8, 2019, and the case was considered a “dissolution with minor children” due to their young ones. They sought joint legal and physical custody of Elsie and Charlie.</p><p>Just before Pechenik submitted the divorce filing, <a href=#>multiple sources confirmed to Us</a> that Deschanel is dating <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Scott</strong></a>. She made her relationship with the 42-year-old Property Brothers star Instagram official thereafter.</p><p>“Jonathan and Zooey <a href=#>had instant chemistry when they met</a> on [the] set [of <a href=#>Carpool Karaoke</a>],” an insider previously told Us. “They’ve bonded over their love of music, film, theatre — and Christmas carols.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scott also told Us exclusively that his romance with Deschanel caught him “a little off guard” but that it “was definitely a pleasant surprise.”</p><p>In addition to Pechenik, the Failure to Launch actress was married to Death Cab for Cutie frontman <strong>Ben Gibbard</strong> from 2009 to 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGazp5%2Baxm6wxKyaoZmemrlussinmKWhqprAbrDIr6arm5Vis7O7zGahmpufl3qxscKhnKehm2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
