I didn’t actually start to live my life until I left the business, and you don’t want to do that. So, you do make a lot of sacrifices in the business, but you have to stay humble and you have to live that normal life. That’s what I do now. It keeps me grounded.”</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>ON BEING A BRAT</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>However, while he did end up living a private life, it wasn't an easy transition as he was once so used to the perks and privileges that come with fame.

In the industry, there are people who convince you to be a certain way, but to him, it's important to know who you are and not what others want you to be. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bce4OUYRJUc">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"There’s a lot of people who are going to try and tell you who you are; try to convince you who you are.
