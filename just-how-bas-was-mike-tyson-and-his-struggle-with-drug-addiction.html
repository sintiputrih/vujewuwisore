Tyson has fought back against battling drug addiction and problems with alcohol for much of his life despite putting together a legendary boxing career. This one will be a little different because we are focusing on Tyson, his addiction, and the effects of it on his life and long fight for sobriety. We will follow what has happened in the intervening time, including his admission that he smokes marijuana, and his transformation.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Life of Tyson</h2><p>Tyson himself even admits that he's an addict with his demons to battle against.&nbsp;Tyson went into rehab but his addiction escalated following the death of his much-loved mentor, Cus D'Amato, and he quit boxing for good in 2005. It has been an on-again, off-again journey for Tyson in terms of his fight against sobriety and that remains the same to this day. Though his discipline was second to none within the boxing ring, outside of it he found it hard to resist cravings for drugs and alcohol.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Transparency in Tyson's Drug Utilization</h2><p>After making his comeback to the sport in the boxing ring last year, Tyson revealed that he smoked marijuana "every day." The news, as would be expected, came as a shock to both the public and to anyone else who watched him preparing for this fight like his life depended on it. Tyson also owns a 40-acre marijuana farm in California—as if he needed more over-the-top representations in the cannabis industry. It also raised eyebrows because of his daily marijuana use, and how he opened up about using it while boxing and showed no shame or regrets.</p><h2>The Effect of His Drug Use on Tyson Life</h2><p>Tyson's drug addiction had affected both his personal life as well as his professional commitment. His history of marijuana use and other substances has led to discussions about addiction among public figures and athletes. His advocacy of the medicinal properties of cannabis, and his links to the cannabis industry mean that the role of drug use and its desirability in society has further deepened the controversy.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Ongoing Battle for Sobriety</h2><p>Despite that, he tries to follow the law and says that he stayed off marijuana during certain boxing matches where he had to be drug tested. His publicist clarified that while he has decided to stop using marijuana as a mere means to an end to stay out of trouble, he still fully supports the drug for medicinal purposes. This also illustrates the darkness of addiction and the struggle faced in being able to combine personal health with professional obligations.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>In the End</h2><p>The story serves as a cautionary tale of the&nbsp;troubles of addiction and highlights the devastating effect it can have on a person, no matter their status within mankind. His battle with addiction and relationship with his fight to stay sober makes visible the darker road so many face when trying to stay clean. It is with this that I leave Tyson as he traverses his path; his story is merely a glimpse of the strength and will that it takes to fight addiction, to move on, to heal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miZqLCZo7RwttSsq2agn6x6o63SZq6aq12itqyxjK2wrKeeYq6vsIyhoKxlo6m%2FtrPGpZxmr5mptW6w0a6eZpmUmbakwMiopQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
