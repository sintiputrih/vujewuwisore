It was the right call, I think, at the time, and it was a realization that while we did love who we were in that moment, <a href=#>there’s a lot more to marrying someone</a> than just that.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While twosome briefly <a href=#>gave their relationship another try</a> after cameras stopped rolling, they ultimately decided to call it quits for good prior to the season 4 reunion in April.</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“We decided that we were going to try, and we eventually did try,” Micah explained to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> at the time. “At that point, we were doing long distance and what was really hard about that was that the foundation was such a mess.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Peden later faced heat from Lussier — and cohost <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> — when he confessed he couldn’t see the marketing campaign manager as a mother.
