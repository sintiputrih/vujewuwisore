As you’d expect, this does mean that Sasuke survived the original Naruto and Naruto Shippuden series.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>In the opening prologue of Boruto’s first episode, we see Boruto facing off against Kawaki with no sign of Naruto or Sasuke being around. Furthermore, Boruto is seen to be wielding Sasuke’s sword. We also have seen Sasuke give Boruto his headband, and anime fans will know that gestures like this can often indicate a passing of the torch on its way.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>For now, Sasuke fans can relax as the shinobi is still around, however, his power has been severely limited since it peaked. Sasuke had one of his eyes stabbed by Boruto as he was controlled by Ishhiki losing access to the Rinnegan.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Also, the power scaling, in general, has tipped in favor of new characters and further away from legacy ninja — like Naruto and Sasuke — so it wouldn’t be outlandish to suggest someone could best them in battle.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>If you’re a fan of Sasuke you can relax for now, but as Boruto continues we’ll likely get more indication of what his future in the franchise looks like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6dpp6rXaiutMHKnmSdoZVitq95waiprqyfZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
