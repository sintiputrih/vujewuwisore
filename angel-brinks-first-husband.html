However, her rise to success didn’t come without hardship.</p><p>In July 2007, just two weeks before her first child was born, her first husband died by apparent suicide. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, the couple was only married for three months and had recently divorced before his death.</p><p>As a result of the stress that his death caused, her son, Azari, was born about a month early. In 2016, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> about the event, writing, “My ex-husband passed away when I was 34 weeks pregnant with my son. I had Azari two weeks later prematurely from the sadness and stress.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My ex-husband passed away when I was 34 weeks pregnant with my son.

Born in Brooklyn, N.Y, the rapper and his group of friends were discovered by the rap group Onyx and later signed by Gang Green. Along with his and Angel's son, X1 also had a son with his first wife, Baby Vasquez.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On July 4, 2007, he was found dead in his Las Vegas home. At the time of his death, he was just 28 years old. Though Angel has continued to say that her son's father took his own life, Baby has argued that X1 was a victim of a homicide that was staged to look like a suicide during a Fourth of July fireworks display. Baby's claims were never confirmed by authorities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How old is Angel Brinks’s son Azari now? Here’s what we know about him.</h2><p>Years after his father’s death, soon-to-be 15-year-old Azari is all grown up. Although Angel was able to avoid the topic for a while, as her son grew older, he started asking some pretty tough questions.</p><p>She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossip</a> in 2016, “He’d watch cartoons, see situations there and wonder ‘Where’s my daddy?’”</p><p>“I’m not sure what’s harder — when fathers are in your life and leave or die, or never knowing them at all. When someone passes, at least we knew them and had them in our lives,” she went on. “As a parent, I struggle with that.”</p><p>Despite facing hardship and tragedy very early in life, Azari seems to be thriving. In Angel’s Instagram stories, he can be seen shooting hoops like a pro.</p><p>You can see Angel on new episodes of Basketball Wives, airing on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on VH1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruosctmmauhnqDAbrLIq6qtZZiqwKOtzZ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
