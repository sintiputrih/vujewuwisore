Ford accrued more than 80 credits across more than 30 years in the business. His roles as an up-and-comer in the 1980s and ‘90s read like the factory-setting resume of an actor at the time, with single-episode appearances on MacGyver, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law & Order</a>, A Different World, and that The Flash series from 1990 that everyone forgets about.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>He landed his career-defining role on Martin at 28, then went on to appear semi-regularly on the relatively short-lived Dick Wolf police procedural New York Undercover in 1998 and ‘99. He’d spend the majority of the next two decades in a litany of smaller roles, voicing an episode of The Proud Family, popping up in seven episodes of The Parkers, landing a guest role on House, and snatching up plenty of faith-based, direct-to-DVD projects.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tommy Ford (@bigtommyford)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Later in life, Ford experienced a series of health issues. In late September 2016, he received a knee replacement surgery, posting to social media about his recovery process and thanking his fans for their prayers. He expressed excitement at the prospect of returning to work.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Sadly, that was an idea that would never come to pass. In early October 2016, not long after receiving his life-altering operation, Ford experienced a ruptured abdominal aneurysm and was placed on life support. On Oct.12, 2016, his family announced via Instagram that Ford had passed away at age 52.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZaSkuq7FjJ%2BpqKVdoq6zwMinZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
