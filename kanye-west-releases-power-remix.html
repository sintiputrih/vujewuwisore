It features Jay-Z and Swiss Beatz and while I loved the original, the remix is even better.
Jay-Z once again helps Kanye deliver another great track and I think this one is even better than the Diamonds From Sierra Leone remix that Kanye and Jay-Z did for the album, Late Registration.
Kanye also released a little snippet of another one of his upcoming songs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m not too sure on the title though. Some websites are calling it ‘Ghetto University’ but Kanye has said the track will be called ‘All Of The Lights’. Either way it’s only about a minute but it features Drake and it sounds pretty good. I’ve included it below.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>So far we have three songs from the new album. ‘Power’, ‘All Of The Lights’ and ‘See Me Now’. All of them sound great and they’re completely different from anything on his last album, 808’s and Heartbreaks. This should make a lot of people happy seeing as Kanye was heavily criticized for using too much auto-tune on his last album.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true><strong>See Me Now (ft.
