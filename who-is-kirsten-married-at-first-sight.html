At least, that's the case in the season premiere of Married at First Sight. She's a successful real estate agent who doesn't want her new husband to be intimidated by her success. Whether or not that's the case with Shaquille remains to be seen. However, she definitely knows what she wants in a spouse.</p><p>"I decided to give this experiment a chance because I knew the person I would be matched with wanted a committed relationship," Kirsten told Distractify.</p><p>While she didn't exactly have a hard time finding that out in the real world, she does have a failed relationship in her past that she'd hoped would lead to marriage, even though it didn't. By signing up for the show, Kirsten took matters into her own hands.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Religion is a big part of Kirsten's life outside of 'MAFS.'</h2><p>Kirsten explains on the show that she's looking for a "Godly man" to share her life with. And, she told us, that was a big deal for her when she spoke to the MAFS experts.</p><p>"Religion is important to me and it was a deal breaker for me," Kirsten said. "As a child and as an adult, I pray daily and attend church. I want my future family to be raised in a Baptist church."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kirsten came close to being engaged once before.</h2><p>Although she shared with us that her last major relationship didn't lead to marriage, Kirsten did admit, "My ex purchased an engagement ring for me."</p><p>Of course that doesn't necessarily mean that she found her perfect match in Shaquille, but the show's experts are certain their personalities and outlooks on life are compatible enough for this relationship to stick for Kirsten.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKShoqjBprqMppirqpmasW6t02adoqqjqXq0tcahqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
