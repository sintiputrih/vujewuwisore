While <a href=#>TikTok</a> has been around long enough for people to establish some pretty successful e-careers for themselves and there are users of various age groups and cultural backgrounds using the application, the "face" of TikTok undeniably skews young.&nbsp;</p><p>This helps to breed a specific online culture endemic to the application itself, which includes new slang, like "/HJ." But what does it mean?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do /HJ and /J mean on TikTok?</h2><p>It just means "half-joking" and "joking," respectively. Yes, we've moved away from "jk" to "/J," this is tremendous progress for the future of online communication.</p><p>And while I'm definitely being sarcastic, there does seem to be a reason behind the "/HJ" nomenclature and homogenizing web shorthand.</p><p>For example, if you're trying to indicate sarcasm through text, which is sometimes hard to decipher on account of tone, you'd append a "/S" to show that you're being facetious with your remark. It seems that this specific manner of online communication has found its way to TikTok and you have tons of users implementing the "/(insert your letter here)".</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i need to start using /lh /j /hj and stuff on snapchat because my friends don‚Äôt get my humor üíî</p>‚Äî emma??

The ":T" emoji used to refer to a "wry smile" &nbsp;because it kind of appears to look like a half grin. Wayword Radio writes, "The slang expression 'No Tea, No Shade,' meaning 'No disrespect, but ‚Ä¶' is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">common in the drag community</a>, where T means 'truth.' The related phrase 'All Tea, All Shade,' means 'This statement is true, so I don‚Äôt care if it offends you or not.' At least as early as the 1920s, the slang verb to shade has meant 'to defeat.'"</p><p>So if you didn't know, now you do!
