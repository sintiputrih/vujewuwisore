Imperial cadets were shipped off to Imperial Academies, and subjected to rigorous training programs in order to produce highly trained shock troopers fiercely loyal to the Empire.<h2>Why are storm troopers not clones?</h2>The main motivation for the switch to Stormtroopers was simply that cloning became too expensive. The costs of ordering, growing, and training clones were exorbitant, and their timetable to become full soldiers was lengthy.<h2>Are stormtroopers and clones the same?</h2>Clone troopers are genetically superior war veterans trained for wartime, while stormtroopers are largely/wholly birth-born recruits trained for peacetime.<h2>Are All STORMTROOPERS Clones? - Star Wars: The Force Awakens</h2><p></p><h2>Is Finn cloned?</h2>Finn was a male human. During his time with the First Order, he wore the standard-issue stormtrooper armor.<h2>Why did Palpatine stop using clones?</h2>Bad Batch theory reveals the genius reason the Empire stopped using clones. For some, the Empire offered a dangerous path to a better life. The galaxy's greatest evil had to start somewhere. In Star Wars: The Bad Batch, we're witnessing the Empire's infancy, and with it, some less-than-glamorous growing pains.<h2>Is General Grievous a droid?</h2>Grievous, born Qymaen jai Sheelal, was the cyborg Supreme Commander of the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems for most of the Clone Wars. Grievous was originally a Kaleesh from the planet Kalee, where he lived his early life.<h2>What was Order 65 in Star Wars?</h2>Order 65 stated that if a majority of the Senate or the Security Council declared that the Supreme Chancellor—at that time Palpatine—was unfit for duty, the Chancellor was to be arrested or, if necessary, killed.<h2>Did any clones become Jedi?</h2>The Clone Trooper nicknamed Glitch took his loyalty to the Jedi further than his brethren, believing that he too could use the Force, though he never exhibited any Force sensitivity.<h2>Are there female stormtroopers?</h2>Behind the scenes. This anonymous stormtrooper was the first female stormtrooper in Star Wars Legends, though Jes Gistang is the first female stormtrooper to be named.<h2>Do stormtroopers get paid?</h2>In most canonically documented cases, Stormtroopers also received regular pay in Imperial credits. However, due to the nature of the Empire's conscription program, much of that pay didn't stay with the soldiers themselves. That's because many recruits sent their pay directly back to their families on their homeworlds.<h2>Who was the first clone trooper?</h2>Captain Rex, CT-7567, leads Torrent Company of the 501st Legion, often under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano. He first appears in The Clone Wars film and its related television series, and he is the primary clone trooper character of the series.<h2>Who are the Red stormtroopers?</h2>Sith troopers wore red armor that evoked the bloodstained legacy of their ancient namesake. Sith trooper armor consisted of a red gammaplast composite, quadruple-layered to a dense, highly impact-resistant finish worn over a hermetically sealed black body glove.<h2>Who would win clones vs stormtroopers?</h2>Clone troopers were actually competent and could hit their targets, so they would win. I kind of think stormtroopers because although clones were made to fight, they didnt have as much training as stormtroopers because they had growth accelerators. Per the Clone Wars there's actually very FEW Clone troopers.<h2>Are all stormtroopers human?</h2>Unlike the old Empire, the Empire of the Hand recruited stormtroopers from a variety of Humanoid sources. Though the stormtrooper ranks remained consistently dominated by Human male recruits, it marked the first time that Non-Humans were allowed to serve as Imperial soldiers.<h2>What is Order 99?</h2>Order 99 was an order arranged by Jedi Master CaptainR1. It turned the storm troopers back to side of the new Republic. During the clone wars, clone commando "Roger" refused Order 66. He was very close to the Jedi he was fighting with.<h2>What was Order 69?</h2>Order 69 was one of many orders in a series of contingency orders which the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic were programmed with. This order demanded that all attractive female Jedi were not to be executed, but instead captured and married to the most successful trooper in the capturing unit.<h2>What was Order 67 Star Wars?</h2>Order 67 was an order requiring clone troopers to begin dancing. During the Battle of Utapau, Darth Sidious accidentally executed Order 67 when he meant to use Order 66. Just after the order was executed, Cody and his troops began dancing.<h2>Why is Grievous always coughing?</h2>Dooku was actually responsible for the crash, but told Grievous that it was the Jedi who had sabotaged the shuttle. This in turn fueled his hatred of the Jedi. As a result of the enhancements, his organic lungs were irritated by some of the implants, resulting in his persistent cough.<h2>How did Anakin get his scar?</h2>Origins of the Scar<p>In the comic, Anakin fights a lightsaber duel with Count Dooku's apprentice, Asajj Ventress. She eventually gets the upper hand but decides to show off her precision. Instead of killing him, she swipes the tip of her lightsaber over his right eye.</p><h2>Why is Mace Windu's lightsaber purple?</h2>The Jedi initiate heals his adversary with help from the Force and, by way of thanks, is given a gift: purple crystals. He uses these crystals to assemble his lightsaber, which emits a distinctive purple blade.<h2>Who was the best clone trooper ever?</h2><p>Star Wars: The 10 Best Clones in the Franchise (Ranked)</p><li>1 Boba Fett.</li><li>2 Rex. ...</li><li>3 Hunter. ...</li><li>4 Fives. ...</li><li>5 Wrecker. ...</li><li>6 Echo. ...</li><li>7 Commander Cody. ...</li><li>8 Omega. ...</li><h2>Were there any clones that disobeyed Order 66?</h2><p>Nevertheless, clones from both canons managed to disobey Order 66 through various means.</p><ul><li>Able.
