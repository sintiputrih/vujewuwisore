Even football quarterbacks got the reality treatment in 2023 with the release of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Quarterback</a></strong>, a docu-series providing an insider, behind-the-scenes look at the lives of our favorite NFL quarterbacks.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>Its often the most visible, if not necessarily the most important, position in football, and the best quarterbacks often become stars in their own right. The likes of Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Joe Montana all made names for themselves as the quarterbacks of their various teams, and in many cases hung onto that fame long after they walked off the field.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>That fame is set to stretch even further with the assistance of Quarterback, which zeroed in on three separate quarterbacks — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs</a>,&nbsp;Kirk Cousins of the Minnesota Vikings, and Marcus Mariota&nbsp;of the Atlanta Falcons — in its first season. Season 2 promises more of the same for the football fanatics out there, but when it will arrive — if it can even find fresh subjects to follow — is still up in the air.</p><h2 id=h-when-could-season-2-of-quarterback-release data-injectable=false>When could season 2 of Quarterback release?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Season 1 of Quarterback released, in its entirety, on July 12, 2023. Its eight-episode premier season followed a trio of talented quarterbacks through the duration of the 2022 NFL season, which ran from Sept. 8, 2022 to Jan. 8, 2023.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>A potential season 2 of the series would likely follow the same format, picking several quarterbacks to follow over the course of the incoming football season. Who those players might be, however, is still up in the air, and that leaves the series up in the air as well. Until Peyton Manning — who is Executive Producer on the show — locates his new subjects, filming for the series can’t begin, and we subsequently can’t learn when it will release.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Assuming Manning and his team manage to find some willing participants, a release window for season 2 of Quarterback will likely follow in similar course to season 1. The crew will follow those athletes over the course of the 2024 season, which begins on Sept. 5, 2024 and ends Jan. 5, 2025, and release the followup season several months later, likely in the summer. Its hard to say if it will mimic season 1 directly, and release on July 12, but a release sometime between June and August seems likely.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who might Quarterback season 2 follow?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Quarterback-cast.jpg><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Its hard to say who will step up to become the next set of subjects for Quarterback, but there are plenty of options to choose from. The three quarterbacks followed in the first season all expressed their enjoyment of the process, but fresh subjects aren’t lining up to participate in season 2. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Manning has been candid</a> about the struggle in finding willing quarterbacks, which leaves the show’s eventual subjects — and its future as a whole — in question.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>We can rule at least three potential quarterbacks out of the running, due to their previous involvement with the series. Its highly unlikely that Mahomes, Cousins, or Mariota will return for season 2, which leaves any of the more than 30 alternate starting quarterbacks to choose from.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where to stream Quarterback</h2><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=false>Season 1 and (hopefully) that eventual season 2 of Quarterback are available to stream over on Netflix. The streamer created the series in conjunction with the NFL, alongside Manning, NFL Films, 2PM Productions, and Omaha Productions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yywcCrq56qkpawrHnSnpisp55if26%2BxKWcmquVYsSqusOormaZnpl6rrvRnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
