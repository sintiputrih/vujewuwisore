Her supremely selfie-worthy clothing, intimates, and shapewear brand, Skims, is all about better, size-inclusive solutions, but there's one collection in particular that's so popular, the brand can't seem to keep it in stock. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cotton Jersey Collection</a> is a Skims best-seller, featuring cozy everyday essentials like bralettes, underwear, tanks, tees, and leggings — all made from high-tech, supportive cotton that's designed to be stretchy, breathable, and brilliantly soft. And like all other Skims wearables, sizes range from XXS to 4X.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unsurprisingly, the collection has racked up an over 40,000-person waitlist and more than 3,000 five-star reviews — plus plenty of hype on TikTok and Instagram (ICYMI, Kourtney Kardashian and Megan Fox literally blew up the Internet with a super hot topless campaign for the line). Luckily, plenty of styles are still available after its most recent September restock, so we decided to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>try out some of the most popular pieces firsthand</a> to help you decide what to order while you still can. Spoiler alert: You should get one of everything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To fully honor Skims' focus on size-inclusivity, we asked 10 different-sized InStyle shopping writers and editors to test one of four items from the Cotton Jersey Collection over the course of a week. They chose between the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">T-shirt bodysuit</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">mock-neck tank</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">triangle bralette</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">T-shirt</a>, experimenting with how to style their chosen piece and where to wear it. Each person shared their honest thoughts about the item's fit, feel, versatility, and even deemed whether or not it's worth the hype. Keep reading for everything you need to know about the trendiest pieces from this top-rated Skims collection.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skims Cotton Jersey T-Shirt Bodysuit</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Skims</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nordstrom</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">T-shirt up top, thong down low — this bodysuit gives you that flawless tucked-in look without the unflattering bumps or bulging panty lines. Its classic crewneck is casual enough to wear with straight-leg jeans and sneakers, while its stretchy cotton jersey fabric still manages to keep the silhouette streamlined enough to style with a skirt. For function, its breathable material makes it ideal for fall layering and a double-snap closure at the crotch allows for easy access.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you're going to go for that effortless, cool-girl look, this essential achieves just that," wrote Ecommerce Writer/Editor, Jennifer Chan. "I don't normally wear T-shirts (often I find them unflattering, too tight, or too boxy), but this bodysuit actually flattered my curves in the same effortless, minimalistic way. It was super soft to the touch, and overall very comfortable. I wouldn't entertain any other options that may be cheaper because you can feel the quality with this piece."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amazon Ecommerce Writer, Eden Lichterman also claims that the bodysuit fit her uniquely well. "This is the first bodysuit I've tried that's actually comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time," she wrote. "The fabric is ridiculously soft, it hugs your body in all the best places, and you don't have to worry about panty lines. I want one in every color. It's the perfect piece to layer under sweaters or jackets, but it's still cute enough to wear on its own with a pair of high-waisted pants or a skirt."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our reviewers both agreed the bodysuit fits true-to-size, although it's intentionally a bit snug — especially around the arm area, according to Lichterman. "The bodysuit as a whole is still extremely comfortable, but I felt like the tight sleeves made my arms bulge out a bit," she noted. If you prefer a slightly less clingy fit, Chan suggests sizing up.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skims Cotton Jersey Mock Neck Tank</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Skims</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nordstrom</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's just something about this jersey tank that feels refreshingly retro. Maybe it's the contrasting tonal pick stitching or the mock turtle neckline with a wide ringer band, but this piece seamlessly manages to blur the lines between traditional and trendy. A full-coverage back complements its modest front cut, while the soft and stretchy jersey fabric clings to your curves for a flattering fit. Its breathable fabric and sleeveless structure make this tank perfect for transitional dressing — wear it alone or as a base layer with a lightweight jacket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't realize how much I was going to like this top until slipping it on," wrote Amazon Writer, Sanah Faroke. "It's so extremely soft and has a ton of stretch. I'm always weary about tight clothes, however, it smoothes over my body and feels great at the same time. Honestly, it feels like I'm not wearing a thing — I don't think I could say that about any other article of clothing in my closet. It's also super versatile. I can wear it with pretty much any high-waisted bottom... If you're looking for a comfortable, lounge-worthy top that can totally be dressed up or down, this is it, people!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lifestyle Ecommerce Lead, Christie Calucchia agrees that the tank's versatility is a huge selling point: "It's tight without feeling constricting and looks great with the baggy pants that are everywhere right now," she said. "The tank is also ideal for layering underneath jackets and sweaters."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The first thing I noticed when I put on this tank is that its form-fitting fabric somehow made the outline of my bra practically disappear — and this is a well-worn bra that's started to show through some of my looser shirts," wrote Ecommerce Deals Writer, Isabel Garcia. "Plus, it looks good alone and layered with outwear."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some of our testers pointed out that its $34 price tag is a little steep for a basic tank, but as Faroke justifies, "I've bought clothes more expensive than this and they're not nearly as soft, comfy, or stretchy… It's totally worth the buy. "</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skims Cotton Jersey Triangle Bralette</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Skims</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nordstrom</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With this thoughtfully designed everyday bralette, comfort and support go hand-in-hand. Partially adjustable straps and a center hook-and-eye closure in the back allow you to customize your fit, while a mesh inner lining and elastic underband ensure you're appropriately lifted for all-day wear. Tastefully tiny triangle cups and a plunging neckline keep the look sleek and sexy, especially when paired with the matching <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">dipped thong</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cheeky tanga panties</a> that are made of the same super soft cotton jersey fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's super soft and feels supportive without being padded at all, which I appreciate," wrote Ecommerce Partnerships Writer, Ariel Scotti. "The designers behind this bralette were thoughtful and made something I look forward to wearing because I forget I have it on. I also really like that it's thick enough to prevent anyone else knowing if you're cold — if you know what I mean!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Entertainment/Celebrity Ecommerce Lead, Alex Warner echoed that the barely-there feel of this bralette is what makes it so special. "The material is so soft against my skin that sometimes I don't even realize I'm wearing a bra," she wrote. "If you want something that will simultaneously make you feel comfortable and confident, get this bra (and the matching underwear)."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lifestyle Writer, Nina Huang also confirmed that this bralette is all about comfort. "It's very soft and much stretchier than I thought. I hate bras that dig into my ribcage when I'm a little bloated and this bralette is forgiving enough to avoid the tight sensation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two reviewers noted that the straps are thick enough to be slightly uncomfortable, though Warner suggested that for her, they're actually a huge selling point: "One of the things I love most is that the straps are adjustable and the back has a clasp," she wrote. "So many times I've bought a bralette and it just doesn't fit right around my chest. The cut of the bra is very flattering for my small chest, which I personally love."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skims Cotton Jersey T-Shirt</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Skims</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nordstrom</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, the perfect T-shirt does exist. This classic crewneck offers everything you want and more from a basic tee, featuring a simple, minimalist style that's embellished by sporty pick stitching, plus a not-too-long full length that cuts off high at the hips. Its silky soft cotton/spandex blend molds to your body for a snug fit, but is still breathable enough to keep you cool and comfortable through a busy day of wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love that it's super form-fitting without clinging to flaws," wrote Christina Butan, Amazon Ecommerce Writer and Strategist. "I'm not sure what kind of black magic Skims is using, but this is the most flattering T-shirt I've ever tried. The fabric is also comfy and breathable... I'm planning on adding more to my collection ASAP. $48 for a T-shirt may seem a little pricey, but trust me, you won't want to wear another tee again after you see how this one fits."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ecommerce Editor, Zarah Kavarana also suggests that the T-shirt's figure-hugging fit is what makes it so special. "I never thought I could love a basic black T-shirt so much, but here I am: completely smitten," she wrote. "From its wear-with-everything versatility to its light and breathable fabric, there's not a single thing I don't like about this tee. It definitely gives off a sleeker, sexier vibe than other cotton T-shirts I own, but its form-fitting, curve-hugging compression is actually what I love about it most — so sickeningly flattering."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Convinced?
