You’ve got a goal you never reach, and it’s always farther away. It keeps you walking, I don’t want to sit down.</li><li>I wanted to do different movies. I wanted to do deeper movies. More human movies based on human feelings.</li><li>It’s not a matter of becoming a superstar. Fame and money aren’t the purposes of all this. No actor’s going to say, ‘I don’t want to be famous.’ But the main purpose of doing what I’m doing is the passion in the work.</li><li>It may be a mistake to say this, but I know my limitations as an actor and I know what I can and can not do. Robert De Niro can do everything. I can’t. A ‘Highlander’ movie is basically my thing. What I’m attempting to do is develop my ability as an actor and try to be the best I can be in the fantasy/action genre.</li><li>Now I don’t want to feel cornered as an actor, because I’ve got a wider range than that.</li><li>If you’re lucky enough to be raised in a rich family, good. But learn how to respect that luck. It’s not a given, you know? It’s not like, ‘Well, it’s normal’. No, it’s not normal. It’s lucky.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-lambert-website></span><span>Christopher Lambert Website</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>www.christopherlambert.org/<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-lambert-youtube></span><span>Christopher Lambert Youtube</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-lambert-facebook></span><span>Christopher Lambert Facebook</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-lambert-twitter></span><span>Christopher Lambert Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by ChrisLambert57</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-lambert-instagram></span><span>Christopher Lambert Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0wM6pn56qXaGurq7Eq6tmmpmkeqKv06ipZqyYmnqjuMCcoqWho6l6qbXGoaOappSav26txp5kn5mdnrm6ecyaqauhlZl6rrvVopysZZGjsW7A1WaqoaenqHpzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
