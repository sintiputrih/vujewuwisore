Happy shopping!</p><p>Is it a ridiculous excuse to say that we feel like our clothes are holding us back from getting the fullest out of our workouts? It sounds silly in our minds, but we honestly think it’s true. If our clothes are rubbing against our skin, refusing to wick away any moisture and forcing us to readjust their fit every other minute, then they’re hindering our experience without a doubt!</p><p>These are just a few of the reasons people spring for pricy brands like Lululemon when it comes to athletic wear. When you feel good in your workout clothes, your workout tends to go better. That’s not just physically, but mentally too. If you become frustrated in your head, you’re not going to want to do that last set of leg lifts — but when you’re feeling good, you’ll be ready to take on the world. But what if you don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars just to grab a few good pieces? You can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">hit up Amazon instead</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Lemedy Padded Sports Bra Tank Top </a>starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$17 </a>at Amazon!

If you look carefully though, you’ll find a few precious diamonds brilliantly shining in the rough. One of those diamonds? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">This Lemedy top</a>. Shoppers say it “feels like Lululemon quality material without the price tag” — and it’s cute to boot!</p><p>This athletic top doubles as a sports bra, featuring a shelf layer inside as well as removable padding. Reviewers say it does an amazing job holding everything in, adding that the support is unreal. They seriously can’t get over the excellent quality of this piece, calling it so comfortable that they sometimes even forget they’re wearing a sports bra. They obviously want it in every color. There are nine, by the way!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Lemedy Padded Sports Bra Tank Top </a>starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$17 </a>at Amazon!
