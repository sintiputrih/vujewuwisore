He buys organizational supplies for fun. I open my drawers and suddenly all of my kitchen utensils are tidy and organized. He’s the guy who is vacuuming out the car and running it through a car wash BEFORE a road trip. Within an hour the windshield is covered with bugs but his philosophy is that at least it started out clean.</p><p>Years ago, he saw that I was constantly running back and forth to the pantry to gather all of my baking supplies. He knew there had to be a better way and came up with a fabulous idea — a BAKING CENTER.</p><p>We cleaned out a small cabinet and placed all of our baking supplies — flour, sugar, chocolate, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in it. My Kitchenaid mixer fits snugly right underneath the cabinet so everything is within reach.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kitchen-Baking-Supplies-Organization-Chocolate-Chips-in-Jars-720x527.jpg alt="Kitchen Baking Supplies Organization.

I wanted to surprise him by organizing my baking center again with all of my most used baking ingredients in one place. This is what makes him happy and after being married for almost 26 years, I love making him happy.</p><p>Since I am baking all of the time, I want to have every integral baking ingredient on hand so I don’t have to be running to the grocery store every time a baked good craving hits.&nbsp;</p><p>I ordered a bunch of <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B072VT6ZDR data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>tall glass jars off Amazon</a> and <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B082X6XCKF data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>glass jars with wood lids</a> and <a href=#>larger glass ones with wood lids from Crate and Barrel</a>.

If you have a Winco close by where you live, you can get amazing deals in their bulk section. I love to buy my Callebaut baking cocoa there for a fraction of the price that you can find online or sold in a prepackaged bag. I went to buy Guittard butterscotch chips and they were much cheaper to buy in the bulk bins. Also, you can get as little or as much as you want so it makes it so easy to keep your baking ingredients stocked and ready.</p><p>I purchased the following baking items in bulk from Winco — Callebaut semi-sweet chocolate chips, Callebaut cocoa powder, powdered sugar, cake flour, bread flour, Bob’s Red Mill rolled oats, almond flour, Guittard white chocolate chips, Guittard butterscotch chips, brown sugar, dark brown sugar, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
