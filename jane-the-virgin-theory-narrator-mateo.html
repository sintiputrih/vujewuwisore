Since the fifth season will be the show's last, the executive producer Jennie Urman has confirmed that viewers will finally find out the identity of the narrator, who cheekily comments on the events surrounding the characters in every episode. She added that there have been "hints throughout" regarding his true identity. As such, one popular theory is that the narrator is actually Jane and Rafael's son Mateo, but all grown up, and all of the signs seem to fit perfectly!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e16c088d7d7-jane-virgin-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e7KPSXipnbpgx data-wc=6><strong>Is little Mateo the real narrator?</strong></p><p id=e-SHP3_e-vOHh data-wc=100>Firstly, the narrator has previously hinted that he knows the Villanueva family very well when Xiomara married Rogelio, saying: "And Xiomara? Well, she looked perfect. At least to the people who loved her most — which includes me." In another scene, Jane is preparing to welcome her baby and unpacks a blankets covered in ducks, prompting the narrator to say: "I do love ducks!" It has been suggested that an adult Mateo could be retelling the story by reading his mother's planned book about the family. Another theory is that the narrator could be Alba's late husband, also named Mateo.</p><p id=eCgvAvVS9ozJ6 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Doc Martin is back!

So unless he was abroad for a while, that's going to be interesting. But it could happen. Either it's going to be one of two extremes: Either he's so tied into this that people will be like, 'Oh, my God!' or he's just the guy who hands out the parking valet tickets at the hotel."</p><p id=e6M4-1KapPnHU data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#> Schoolchildren take over the reins at HELLO! magazine for Channel 4 show When I Grow Up</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
