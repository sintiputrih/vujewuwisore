Moore <a href=#>tweeted</a>. “Also, no one at the label thought to tell him… this ain’t it.” Podcast host Alex Lewis <a href=#>joked</a> about Bieber and the U.S. government both “giving Black people ‘Justice’ but it’s really just MLK quotes.” And early reviews also took issue with Bieber quoting King on an album that largely seemed to be about his wife, Hailey. (Following the interlude, in which King talks about dying for justice, is a song called <a href=#>“Die for You,”</a> on which Bieber sings, “I would walk through burning fire / Even if your kiss could kill me.”) “If you’re wondering why anyone thought it was a good idea to conflate civil-right martyrdom with the thought of succumbing to a hot woman, keep wondering,” <a href=#>Variety wrote</a> in its review. “Hot goings-on, not What’s Going On,” the Guardian <a href=#>headlined its review</a>, referencing Marvin Gaye’s 1971 protest album.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I still can’t get over Justin Bieber naming his album “Justice”<br>and using that MLK audio clip before transitioning into a Fame Monster leftover.

But other artists have had trouble using King speeches in their work, as Moore noted, citing that Ava DuVernay <a href=#>wrote new speeches</a> for her biopic, Selma. “This just feels trashy and inappropriate,” he <a href=#>added</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Each of us, including artists and entertainers, can do something.</p><p>Thank you, <a href=#>@justinbieber</a>, for your support, in honor of <a href=#>#Justice</a>, of <a href=#>@TheKingCenter</a>’s work and of our <a href=#>#BeLove</a> campaign, which is a part of our global movement for justice. <a href=#>#MLK</a> <a href=#>#EndRacism</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/nTkR1XdcvW</a></p>— Be A King (@BerniceKing) <a href=#>March 18, 2021</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckmgmb1zx000m3h6fijjr71w3@published data-word-count=97>When he <a href=#>announced the album three weeks ago</a>, Bieber <a href=#>tweeted</a> about “healing and justice for humanity.” His goal with the album, he added, was “to make songs that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone.” Yet the album barely even alludes to social justice issues, even as Bieber continues to talk about his new music in that context. “If we aren’t standing up for what’s right, what are we doing? It’s very timely and very necessary,” he told press of the King interlude during an album listening event, <a href=#>according to Official Charts</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>In a time when there’s so much wrong with this broken planet we all crave healing and justice for humanity.
