Toyota 4Runner Specifications & FeaturesThe majority of the other mid-size crossovers and SUVs that litter the streets and fill suburban driveways are not like the 2023 Toyota 4Runner. This is due to the 4Runner’s older-than-new vehicle design, which features a pickup-truck frame and boasts true off-road prowess. It features enhanced suspension parts, an electronic locking rear axle, additional underbody armour, and knobby tyres in its most powerful configurations. Every model comes standard with a 270-hp V6 and an automatic transmission, as well as rear- or four-wheel drive."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is due to the 4Runner’s older-than-new vehicle design, which features a pickup-truck frame and boasts true off-road prowess. It features enhanced suspension parts, an electronic locking rear axle, additional underbody armour, and knobby tyres in its most powerful configurations. Every model comes standard with a 270-hp V6 and an automatic transmission, as well as rear- or four-wheel drive. Sadly, that powertrain is outdated when compared to those driving competitors with body-on-frame construction like the Ford Bronco and Jeep Wrangler. The truck’s interior is spacious for both passengers and freight, but the materials are dull. The 4Runner can travel in locations that many of its peers cannot, but outside of those specific, constrained situations, it is unquestionably out of date.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=What8217s_New>What’s New?</span></h3><p>The 4Runner nameplate celebrates 40 years in the 2023 model years. To commemorate, Toyota releases a special edition with a 4040-unit production run based on the base SR5 model. The ’23 4Runner 40th Anniversary Special Edition comes with tri-colored graphics on the body sides and grille and is painted in red, white, or black. There are also a pair of 17-inch bronze wheels included in the package. The stitching on the leatherette seats and shift knob inside is the same bronze tone. The floormats, front headrests, and a few inside emblems also make reference to the 4Runner’s 40th birthday. For 2023, all models come standard with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic warning.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Toyota_4Runner_Engine_Power_Acceleration_Performance>Toyota 4Runner Engine, Power, Acceleration & Performance</span></h3><p>A 4.0-liter V6 engine with 270 horsepower and a five-speed automatic transmission power every 4Runner. The outmoded powertrain offers unimpressive acceleration, with the most recent version needing 7.7 seconds to reach 60 mph. It is available with rear-wheel drive and either full- or part-time four-wheel-drive systems. The automatic’s sluggish reflexes undoubtedly don’t maximise the engine’s erratic performance, and downshifts frequently call for strong right-foot inputs to propel the 4Runner forward. Nonetheless, compared to the more cumbersome Wrangler, the Toyota appears more balanced on pavement. The SUV’s substantial ground clearance is highlighted by the off-road-oriented model, whose body-on-frame design was backed by a soft suspension that handled a variety of terrain quite well.</p><p>Although the small weight and imprecise steering of the 4Runner betray any sense of sportiness, they are suitable for stumbling down trails and navigating parking spaces. Although though the Toyota feels dated while it is in motion, its performance is on par with that of its more contemporary rivals, such as the V-6 Dodge Durango. The Toyota also outperforms the Ford Edge and Wrangler in terms of towing ability, with a 5000-pound capacity, while falling short of the more potent Durango’s 8700-pound limit. This is due to the Toyota’s tough structure and torque-rich engine.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Toyota_4Runner_Mileage>Toyota 4Runner Mileage</span></h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>2023 Toyota 4Runner Mileage</strong></td><td><strong>City</strong></td><td><strong>Highway</strong></td></tr><tr><td>4Runner</td><td>16 mpg</td><td>19 mph</td></tr></tbody></table>4Runner Fuel-Economy</figure><p>Every model of the 4Runner is rated at a pitiful 16 mpg in the city and 19 mpg on the highway, making its powertrain combinations outdated when it comes to gas mileage. The V-6-powered Wrangler, in contrast, is estimated to get up to 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Dimensions_Space>Dimensions & Space</span></h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>2023 Toyota 4Runner Dimensions</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Length</td><td>191.3 in</td></tr><tr><td>Width</td><td>75.8 in</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>&nbsp;71.5 in</td></tr><tr><td>Wheelbase</td><td>109.8 in</td></tr><tr><td>Cargo Volume</td><td>46 ft3</td></tr><tr><td>Airbags</td><td>8 Airbags</td></tr></tbody></table>Toyota 4Runner Dimensions</figure><p>An 8.0-inch smartplay infotainment system is standard on every 4Runner. Together with physical buttons, the interface also has rotating volume and tuning knobs. The system includes a subscription-based Wi-Fi hotspot, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto as standard features. Upgrades include a 15-speaker JBL audio system and an integrated navigation system.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Pricing>Pricing</span></h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>2023 Toyota 4Runner Trims</strong></td><td><strong>Price (USD)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>SR5</td><td>$40,390</td></tr><tr><td>TRD Sport</td><td>$43,250</td></tr><tr><td>TRD Off-Road</td><td>$44,235</td></tr><tr><td>40th Anniversary Special Edition</td><td>$47,705</td></tr><tr><td>Limited</td><td>$49,125</td></tr><tr><td>TRD Pro</td><td>$55,355</td></tr></tbody></table>4Runner Price</figure><p>The TRD Off-Road model is the one we advise. Although it is less capable off-road than the TRD Pro with the lift, it is a better bargain due to its substantially lower price. The TRD Off-Road receives equipment that helps live up to its moniker in addition to basic four-wheel drive and a few TRD-specific exterior and interior components. This offers the best traction possible in slick or muddy conditions thanks to an electronically locking rear differential. Moreover, the Vehicle includes variable drive modes that allow the powertrain to behave differently in order to fit different driving situations. We would go for the optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension, which enhances wheel articulation when driving off-road. The sliding rear cargo deck, which facilitates transporting heavy stuff and even offers tailboard seating, is another option we’d consider.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Specifications_Quarter_Mile_0-60_Mph_Top-Speed>Specifications, Quarter Mile, 0-60 Mph & Top-Speed</span></h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>2023 Toyota 4Runner Specifications</strong></td><td><strong>Specs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Engine</td><td>DOHC 24-valve V6</td></tr><tr><td>Drivetrain</td><td>R/4WD</td></tr><tr><td>Horsepower</td><td>270 hp&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Torque</td><td>278 lb-ft</td></tr><tr><td>0-60 MPH</td><td>7.7 sec</td></tr><tr><td>0-100 MPH</td><td>23.8 sec</td></tr><tr><td>1/4 Mile</td><td>16.0 sec</td></tr><tr><td>Top-Speed</td><td>113 mph</td></tr></tbody></table>4Runner Specs</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h3><p>The 4Runner is well beyond its sell-by date, despite its ground-breaking abilities and off-road heritage. Drives far too much like a truck due to an outdated powertrain and poor cabin quality. Substantial off-roading capability, a tonne of standard active safety measures, and a high towing rating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqYaK8tbvRoqWgZpOkunDAzrKmrZldab%2B2us2eqWaZnKF6sb7InJysZZWjtKq6xGakoqSVlrSmedOop2aroJqypXmPZm1pZZ2ltW6yxJqrrqqVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
