However, he reunited with the band for their 50th anniversary tour in 2012. The following year, he began touring with Brian Wilson’s band.</p><p>Jardine has released several albums throughout his career, including the 2001 album “Live in Las Vegas” with his group Endless Summer Band and the 2010 solo album “A Postcard from California.” He also published a children’s book, “Sloop John B: A Pirate’s Tale,” in 2005.</p><p>In 1988, Jardine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Beach Boys, and in 2019, he was inducted into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Formation_of_The_Beach_Boys>Early Life and Formation of The Beach Boys</span></h2><p>Al Jardine was born in Lima, Ohio in 1942 and grew up in Rochester, New York. His family later moved to San Francisco and then to Hawthorne, California where he attended Hawthorne High School and played football. It was there that he met Brian Wilson, the backup quarterback and future bandmate.</p><p>After graduating high school, Jardine briefly attended Ferris State University before returning to California to attend El Camino College. It was during this time that he and Wilson formed the Beach Boys in 1961 with Brian’s brothers, Carl and Dennis Wilson, and their cousin Mike Love.</p><h2><span id=Al_Jardines_Career_Highlights>Al Jardine’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Al Jardine was an original member of The Beach Boys, playing upright bass on their first recording, “Surfin'” (1961). He left the band in early 1962 but returned full-time in the fall of 1963 and sang lead on the 1965 hit “Help Me, Rhonda.” Jardine urged the band to record a cover of “Sloop John B,” which became a worldwide hit and was ranked #276 on “Rolling Stone” magazine’s 2011 list of “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.” In 2010, Jardine released his debut solo album, “A Postcard from California,” featuring Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Neil Young, and other musicians.

In 2022, he announced the “Family & Friends Tour” featuring his son Matt and Brian’s daughters Carnie and Wendy Wilson.</p><p>However, Jardine’s relationship with the Beach Boys has been contentious. He was ousted from the touring version of the band after Carl Wilson’s death in 1998, and he was later sued by Mike Love for using the Beach Boys name.
