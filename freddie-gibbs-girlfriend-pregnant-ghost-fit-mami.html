However, The Fit Mami has now taken to Twitter to address their breakup, claiming the rapper suddenly began ignoring her earlier this year after she fell pregnant, despite saying he wanted to start a family with her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Griselda rapper had often clowned Gibbs for dating a porn star, even <a class=underline-link href=#>posting an X-rated photo online of her performing oral sex</a>.</p><p>Shortly after the feud died down, the adult film star took Gibbs on a trip to Hawaii with his mom to celebrate his 40th birthday. She said the pair were continuing to have “fun together,” and cited an interview Gibbs gave shortly after the trip with Bootleg Kev where he said he “loves her to death.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/05/benny-butcher-was-taken-aback-by-freddie-gibbs-tweet-that-ignited-feud-250x142.jpeg alt="Benny The Butcher Was ‘Taken Aback’ By Freddie Gibbs Tweet That Ignited Feud" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Benny The Butcher Was ‘Taken Aback’ By Freddie Gibbs Tweet That Ignited Feud</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>May 3, 2023</p></a><p>“He had this idea that we would name the baby penny like penny hardaway if he was a boy,” Destini continued. “Fast forward to november we went out for his friends birthday & we came home super drunk, but he would say shit like this to me even sober.”</p><p>She then posted a video of a drunk Gibbs telling her that she’s “so beautiful” and that he wants to marry her, to which she says,” Okay, let’s do it.”</p><p>“This was november 25 (the night i got pregnant) we fucked like 6 times this day,” she wrote.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>he had this idea that we would name the baby penny like penny hardaway if he was a boy bffr 🙂 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z2dW9LLqEs</a></p><p>— THE FIT MAMI (@destinicreams) <a href=#>May 4, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>fast forward to november we went out for his friends birthday & we came home super drunk, but he would say shit like this to me even sober. this was november 25 (the night i got pregnant) we fucked like 6 times this day. lol <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/csH1ERBCsB</a></p><p>— THE FIT MAMI (@destinicreams) <a href=#>May 4, 2023</a></p><p>However, things seemingly took a turn around that time. Destini soon after found out she was pregnant, and Gibbs apparently began to pull away, telling her at one point that he “wasn’t ready for kids.”</p><p>Destini said she offered to have an abortion, but that she ultimately couldn’t go through it.
