Kyle Abbott (Michael Mealor) will not be able to get over her helping Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) extended her murder hoax.</p><p>Diane Jenkins (Susan Walters) surprised Summer by offering compassion. Lanier’s character asked her mother-in-law for help with Kyle and Diane obliged.</p><p>Kyle understood his mother’s logic, in saying that Summer was put in a bad spot by Phyllis. But a later comment about Harrison Locke (Kellen Enriquez) is chided by Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) for being exaggerated.</p><h3>The Young And The Restless Spoilers – Diane Jenkins Appreciates Circumstances</h3><p><a href=#>Diane is, to a certain extent,</a> still redeeming herself. Part of the process now includes trying to help Summer repair the rift with Kyle.</p><p>However, Jack believes Diane goes too far in talking about how Harrison is being affected by the tension between Kyle and Summer. Bergman’s character does not believe Diane’s comments are truthful and tells his fiance not to go any further.</p><p>Jack will likely realize that Diane is being overly cautious. She could be foreseeing Harrison’s reaction if the separation Kyle calls for lasts for a while and is simply trying to avoid Enriquez’s character being negatively impacted.</p><h3>The Young And The Restless Updates– Kyle Abbott’s Major Mistake With Audra Charles</h3><p>Kyle is teased to cavort with Audra Charles (Zuleyka Silver). His foolhardy reaction to Summer’s mistake is not equal.</p><p>Summer has not cheated on Kyle. Instead, she protected Phyllis, believing the scenario to be temporary until her mother could clear her name.</p><p>But Kyle feels Summer only feels bad because her cover of Phyllis was exposed. It is rather surprising that Mealor’s character would respond this badly. But daytime is about creating drama.</p><p><img alt="The Young and The Restless: Diane Jenkins (Susan Walters) and Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman" width=800 height=450 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/06/the-young-and-the-restless-yr-spoilers-summer-and-kyles-drama-creates-rift-between-jack-and-diane/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Young And The Restless (Y&R) Spoilers: Summer And Kyle’s Drama Creates Rift Between Jack And Diane?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/YR-Jack-and-Diane.jpg></p><h3>Summer Newman Abbott Faces Decision</h3><p><a href=#>Summer is sure to learn about Kyle’s betrayal.</a> He will have no reasonable excuse for willfully involving himself with another woman who he just met.</p><p>Audra’s use of that situation should also prove intriguing. She wants to be tied to the young and powerful in Genoa City, Wisconsin. Nate Hastings (Sean Dominic) is focused on Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), and Audra realizes he is currently unavailable.</p><p>So, it seems possible that Kyle’s wish to separate from Summer could lead to a divorce. TPTB might be positioning Audra to be Kyle’s next romantic interest or more on Y&R.</p><p>This site is a leading source for everything linked to The Young and the Restless. <a href=#>Check back regularly for Y&R spoilers and news!</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49vZq2glWLGsMHNoGSappRiwamxjKucrKycmsC0edirZKyon565pr7SZqqupZ2av26tzZ1kpLGcmsBusNGapJplk6eyosDErGSroZapeqOx07CcnqZdn66kt4yapZ1llJ6ur7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
