"We do bedtime every day," the actress <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>said inside of Allure magazine's May issue</a>. "We felt like as much togetherness as possible would be ideal, and fortunately we really love each other and are best friends, and so that works. It's not that it's not complicated, because it is." The &nbsp;actress and the English actor, who are parents to four-year-old <strong>Marlowe</strong>, ended their relationship in the summer of 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ced4a8ee29ab-sienna-2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e00MTJrUWEnJ data-wc=11>&nbsp;<strong>Sienna opens up about being a single mother</strong> Photo: Getty Images&nbsp;</p><p id=eNq_nygf1KwM data-wc=146>Since then, the 35-year-old has embraced being a single mother. "I had an amazing moment the other day where I just heard this 'Mama!' from upstairs," she expalined. "I said, 'I'm coming, I'm coming.’ And as I got to the landing I just smelled, like, puke. And she'd thrown up basically off the top bunk, so the splatters were like: Pow! Like all four walls. She had the norovirus or whatever. I was like, 'I'm coming, I'm coming!' And I skidded on the sick and fell. Whacked my head. Then I get her out of the bunk; she's crying, covered in sick. I take her to the bathroom, take all her clothes off, and then the dog comes up and starts eating the sick. And I get her in the bath and in my bed, and I'm just, like, literally naked, mopping, and crying at midnight."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ae9f5134d5a-sienna-tom-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e7CgtMNPzKJI data-wc=11><strong>Sienna and Tom are parents to four-year-old Marlowe</strong> Photo: Getty Images&nbsp;</p><p id=eFlTP6Z8QOT6 data-wc=141>Despite the not so glamorous parts of motherhood, Sienna wouldn't change anything for the world. She continued: "You know, and that's parenthood. You're so enriched by it and so fulfilled."&nbsp;The challenges she faces as a mother now have not discouraged her from having more children. When asked if she has plans on expanding her family, the actress responded with laughter, "I would love to. Yeah. I have to figure out the other side of it." Although more children aren't in the immediate future, the single actress, who recently <a class=hm-link href=#>refuted any romance rumours involving Brad Pitt</a>, has a specific vison for her life years down the road. "I see a big lunch table. Outside. It's filled with food. And I want to be that wise, happy granny. And I'm the matriarch at this palazzo in Tuscany, and I'm cooking and looking after little babies."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
