The game features a total of 31 Tablets you need to retrieve for the Well-read trophy/achievement, but unlike the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Dragon Vein Essences</a>, they do not improve your character’s stats.</p><p>The Wo Long Fallen Dynasty Tablet collectibles offer additional information on the game’s lore and the events you are about to experience. Even though they don’t grant any bonuses, these items are mandatory if you are a completionist, and after you reach Mt. Tianzhushan, you can bring them to one of the villagers in the hub area.</p><p>As mentioned, not all Sub Battlefields and Main Battlefields feature this type of collectible; therefore, if you miss some of the Tablets below, you’ll need to replay the said missions using the Travel option available at any of the Battle Flags. Tablets are found like all other items, meaning that you’ll have to look for glowing loot spots you can interact with by pressing <strong>R2/RT</strong>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablet_1_-_Village_of_Calamity_Main_Battlefield>Tablet #1 – Village of Calamity Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>The first Wo Long Fallen Dynasty Tablet is found while playing the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Village of Calamity Main Battlefield</a>, or the first mission in the game. The Tablet (Yellow Turban Bandit’s Note – Part 1) is very accessible because it’s sitting next to the first Battle Flag you’ll have to activate. The said Battle Flag is on the main path you’ll need to follow to complete the Battlefield, and most likely, you’ll use it to rest and recover your lost health. The Table (marked below) is in front of a stone pillar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tablets-locations-1024x576.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablet_2_-_The_Demon_Fort_Of_The_Yellow_Heaven_Main_Battlefield>Tablet #2 – The Demon Fort Of The Yellow Heaven Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>The second Tablet in Wo Long Fallen Dynasty can be found during <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>The Demon Fort Of The Yellow Heaven Main Battlefield</a> or the fourth main mission. The Tablet is located on a platform to the right side of the second set of stairs leading to the final Battle Flag and the fight against Zhang Jiao.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tablet-location-demon-fort-of-yellow-heaven-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablet_3_-_Mt_Tianzhushan_Hidden_Village>Tablet #3 – Mt. Tianzhushan Hidden Village</span></h2><p>The third Tablet collectible is probably the trickiest so far because it is found behind a house in the Mt. Tianzhushan area. When you arrive at the hidden village from the Battle Flag, head left and notice the house with the round water tower nearby. Behind it, you can spot the golden loot spot pictured below. To get the Tablet, use the roots nearby to jump over the gap, then jump on the roof of the house. Drop to the area behind the house to collect the Pining Woman’s Note.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tablets-collectbiles-locations-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablet_4_-_In_Search_Of_The_Immortal_Wizard_Main_Battlefield>Tablet #4 – In Search Of The Immortal Wizard Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>When you play the Main Battlefield named <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>In Search Of The Immortal Wizard</a>, you can find the fourth Tablet, but you’ll need to get to the cave close to the final boss. The said cave is corrupted, and eventually, here, you’ll have to defeat a Zhupolong crocodile. Before fighting the large beast, when you enter the cave, climb the first root on the left side, jump over the gap, and collect the Golden Cicada Shell.</p><p>From the ledge where you found the Cicada, follow the next root and jump to the other section of the cave, where you’ll see a loot spot. Now follow the tunnel ahead, climb the next ledge, and you’ll get to a smaller cave where you should see a Treasure Chest. On the left side is the Despairing Taoist’s Note Tablet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tablets-collectibles-locations-guide-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablets_5_6_-_Fall_Of_The_Corrupted_Eunuch_Main_Battlefield>Tablets #5 & 6 – Fall Of The Corrupted Eunuch Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>The fifth Tablet in Wo Long Fallen Dynasty can be found while playing the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Fall Of The Corrupted Eunuch Main Battlefield</a>. After you reach Battle Flag #2 on the prison’s ground floor, search for a cell with a large Huo Shu blocking the entrance. Enter the nearby cell, climb the hole in the wall, and land a Fatal Strike on the Huo Shu to finish him off, then collect the Prisoner’s Last Words Tablet off the ground.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-fall-of-the-corrupted-eunuch-huo-shu-loot-1024x576.jpg><p>For the next Tablet in Fall Of The Corrupted Eunuch, you’ll have to defeat the first boss, Baishe. Then, continue through the mission until you reach Battle Flag #6 in a large library near the exit to the courtyard.</p><p>Climb up the stairs near Battle Flag #6, jump over the gap, and right in front of you, a bookshelf covers a hole behind. Jump on the bookshelf and go through the hole. In the corner of this room, destroy the wooden crates to reveal the hidden <i>Magnate’s Note</i> Tablet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-fall-of-the-corrupted-eunuch-tablet-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablets_7_8_-_The_Battle_Of_Hulaoguan_Pass_Main_Battlefield>Tablets #7 & 8 – The Battle Of Hulaoguan Pass Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>The next Tablet is found while playing The Battle Of Hulaoguan Pass. Before reaching the battlefield in front of the castle, you must clear a small remote camp with a Battle Flag in the middle. The collectible (Sun Jian Soldier’s Letter) is inside one of the tents (pictured below) in the lower section of the camp, in front of the Battle Flag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-battle-of-hulaoguan-pass-tablets-locations-1024x576.jpg><p>For the next collectible in this mission, you’ll need to reach the castle’s main entrance and the last Battle Flag in front of the large gate leading to the boss. While standing in front of the said entrance, you’ll see a lot of corpses in the clearing. Next to one of them is the Tablet pictured below. It is named Coalition General’s Diary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-battle-of-hulaoguan-pass-tablets-collectbiles-locations-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablets_9_10_11_-_Centuries_of_Glory_Burned_Away_Main_Battlefield>Tablets #9, 10, & 11 – Centuries of Glory Burned Away Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>While playing the Centuries of Glory Burned Away Main Battlefield, where the whole city of Luoyang is in flames, you will be able to find three additional Tablets. The ninth Tablet in Wo Long Fallen Dynasty can be found after you reach the second Battle Flag, which is fairly early in the game. Then, check on the left of Battle Flag #2 to find the Luoyang Townswoman’s Last Words Tablet on the ground, where a Huo Shu will be waiting to ambush you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-centuries-of-glory-burned-away-tablet-1024x576.jpg><p>The following Tablet in Centuries of Glory Burned Away Mission can be found in the courtyard with the corrupted Battle Flag #3, where you’ll have to defeat the Corpse Demon Leader. Then, check to the right of the Battle Flag past a bridge over a pond to find the Colorfully Shining Well Writings Tablet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-centuries-of-glory-burned-away-tablet-location-1024x576.jpg><p>The last Centuries of Glory Burned Away Tablet can be found later in the mission once you reach the final Battle Flag. Go to the left of the Battle Flag, where you will find a Marking Flag. While facing the Marking Flag, climb the building’s rooftop on the left. At the top, you’ll find a hole through the roof that you can use to reach inside and find the Civil Officer’s Last Words Tablet near a Treasure Chest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-centuries-of-glory-burned-away-tablet-locations-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablets_12_13_-_Darkness_Over_The_Hanshui_River_Main_Battlefield>Tablets #12 & 13 – Darkness Over The Hanshui River Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>Two additional tablets are found during the Darkness Over the Hanshui River Main Battlefield. The first one (Brocade Sail Pirate’s Scribblings) is found after you cross the river.</p><p>When you reach the shore where the entrance to the village is found, you’ll have to defeat a Shuigui&nbsp;mermaid patrolling the path up the hill. After you deal with her, check the boat nearby, which is guarded by a Demonized Officer. Deal with him first, then jump on the ship and check the back side of the lower deck. Around the corner, you’ll find a small Treasure Chest and the collectible (pictured below).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-darkness-over-the-hanshui-river-tablets-locations-1024x576.jpg><p>For the next Darkness Over The Hanshui River Tablet, you must clear the village and reach the last Battle Flag in front of a gate. From the Battle Flag, walk up the path without entering the next section and look for a barricade. The Xingyang Townswoman’s Diary Tablet is found inside a house near the barricade (below), very close to the final Battle Flag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-darkness-over-hanshui-river-collectibles-locations-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tablets_14_15_16_Tyrants_Final_Banquet_Main_Battlefield>Tablets #14, 15, & 16: Tyrant’s Final Banquet Main Battlefield</span></h2><p>During the Tyrant’s Final Banquet Main Battlefield in Wo Long Fallen Dynasty, you can find and collect three additional Tablets. The first Tablet can be found shortly after reaching and raising the second Battle Flag. Head along the rooftops and deal with the Assassin and Archer at the bottom of the ladder. Then, continue jumping along the rooftops until you reach the far left corner of the housing area with the Meiwu Fort Guard’s Note Tablet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tyrants-final-banquet-tablet-location-1-1024x576.jpg><p>For the second Tablet, you’ll have to reach the Battle Flag in the cave. Then, take the path to the right of the Battle Flag and defeat the patrolling Demonized Officer. After the Demonized Officer, you’ll reach a junction with a path leading to a large open area and a path going uphill. Follow the path uphill and defeat the Demonized Officer waiting around the corner, then grab the Meiwu Fort Jailer’s Note Tablet off the shelf.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tyrants-final-banquet-tablets-location-1024x576.jpg><p>The third Tablet in Tyrant’s Final Banquet Main Mission can be found immediately after leaving the cave and reaching the Battle Flag in the bamboo garden.

The first one, Cao Cao Soldier’s Note, is found halfway through the mission when you enter the foggy section of the forest. Eventually, you’ll get to an area where you’ll see a Changgui tiger roaming around a large tree. Defeat the tiger first, then look around for a watchtower you can climb.</p><p>When you reach the top of the ladder, cross the wooden bridge ahead, jumping over the hole. Next, turn left and head towards the pagoda. Kick the wood pile to create a shortcut, and climb the painted wall nearby. Now, follow the balcony to get the collectible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-behold-the-glaive-of-righteousness-notes-locations-1024x576.jpg><p>The second Tablet (Yan Liang’s Note) is close to the third Battle Flag you must activate after defeating a Corpse Demon.
