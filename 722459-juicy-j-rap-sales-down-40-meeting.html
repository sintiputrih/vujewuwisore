We gotta figure some shit out. We gotta sit down and talk. Let’s have a meeting, let’s meet up somewhere and have a big ass fucking meeting. Let’s talk about this shit, how we can turn this shit around. Because this is how we eat.

A lot of y’all need to relearn what art is then you may be able to create something of value.” Another added: “Sales down but streams aint. Yall gotta demand more from these streaming services. They're getting rich off the artist and only paying them half a penny.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-juicy-j-on-the-future-of-hip-hop>Juicy J On The <a href=# class=text-word>Future</a> Of Hip-Hop</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Juicy J isn't the only voice to speak on the state of hip-hop this week.
