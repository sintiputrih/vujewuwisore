His fascination in music began at an early age. His father, a jazz musician, gave him his first guitar, and thus his musical journey began. He recorded his debut song, Look for Love, when he was five years old.</h3><h3>George Cole taught him how to play the guitar for approximately ten years. He also learned to play the drums, piano, harmonica, and mandolin, among other instruments. Along with boyhood buddy Mike Dirnt, he established the band Sweet Children. With the help of additional pals, they created the band Green Day two years later. Green Day’s most well-known success is the rock opera American Idiot, which won them numerous honors and was later adapted into a Broadway musical in which Armstrong starred. Let us learn more about him by reading this article.</h3><h2>Billie Joe Armstrong Net Worth:</h2><p>Billie Joe Armstrong has a net worth of <strong>$75</strong> million as an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Armstrong is best known for being the lead singer of the punk rock band Green Day, but he’s also been a member of Pinhead Gunpowder, The Coverups, Foxboro Hot Tubs, The Longshot, and The Network. Green Day’s first two albums, “39/Smooth” (1990) and “Kerplunk!” (1991), cemented their place in the early 1990s Southern California punk scene, but the band was accused of selling out when “Dookie” (1994) was released on a major label and sold more than 8 million copies.</p><p>With each new Green Day album, Armstrong continued to reject the band’s early critics as the group grew in mainstream popularity, culminating in 2004’s “American Idiot,” a rock opera that was a surprise international success, a multi-platinum Grammy winner, and a Tony-winning Broadway musical. Green Day has 13 studio albums to their credit, with over 75 million albums sold, and they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Billie Joe has also co-founded a record company (Adeline Records), built his own guitar shop (Broken Guitars), and co-founded Oakland Coffee Works with his Green Day colleagues.</p><h2>What is Billie Joe Armstrong famous for?</h2><ul><li>Green Day is a punk music band that he is a member of.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/billie-joe-armstrong-nme-300x181.jpg><h2>When was Billie Joe Armstrong born?</h2><p>Billie Joe Armstrong was born in the year 1972, according to his biography.
