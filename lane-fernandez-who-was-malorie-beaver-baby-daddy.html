I love you to the moon and back and I know you’re watching out for us”, she wrote in a Facebook post. In the heartbreaking message, she went on to promise that she will forever miss him and he has/will always be him, her rock and her best friend. Adding “It’s always been you💕 Nolyn, Emerson, and I love you so much and you were an amazing father, dog dad, and husband” she also mentioned Emerson, Malorie’s daughter who was born in 2018.

She had accused them of not being the loving parents they portray themselves to be. And following this, Lane, defending himself, had told The Sun that he tries and tries to see his daughter but cannot. At the time, he also stressed that he had not seen Emerson since Easter. Now-deceased Lane also had said that he was considering filing for joint custody, but because it required “a big money racket”, he was not already ready.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lane Fernandez Cause Of Death</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Lane Fernandez’s cause of death was not disclosed as of now.

Viewers saw his and his ex-girlfriend Malorie’s efforts to co-parent their little girl Emerson, and Lane’s wife Kylee was also in the picture.</p><p style=text-align:left>For instance, a July 2021 episode showed Malorie getting into a nasty online argument with Kylee after the couple posted a birthday tribute to Emerson. Rachel’s sister, who has also been part of the drama, had taken to Facebook to call out Lane and Kylee for portraying themselves as perfect parents. And situations as such always played out on the show. Apparently, the drama only had started after Kylee’s post.</p><p>Lane still did not have regular appearances on the show. He was there when he and Malorie tried to work on their relationship, and in other scenes. And Malorie’s, mother and sister were clearly against their attempted reconciliation at the time; because Malorie had accused Lane of abuse in the past.</p><p style=text-align:left></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpZmemnqnsdGnmKecla96uLTOZq6aq12irq270aKcZpqVlsOmvoybmJuxXZmupbDYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
