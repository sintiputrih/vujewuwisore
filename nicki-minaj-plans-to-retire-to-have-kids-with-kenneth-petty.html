I know you guys are happy now. To my fans, keep reppin me, do it til da death of me, X in the box- cuz ain’t nobody checkin me. Love you for LIFE.”</p><p>Nicki and her boyfriend, Kenneth Petty, obtained a marriage license not too long ago and since then, Minaj has called him her husband.</p><p>“We filed for the marriage license and we still had to pick it up and I was traveling, by the time I came back, we had to renew it again,” the 36-year-old rapper shared on Queen Radio in August. “From that time, you have 90 days to get married. That was about a week ago, so now I have about 80 days.</p><p>She added, “I have to work on my album and I have a lot to focus on that I don’t want to do the big wedding now. We’ll do the big wedding later. I’ll be married before my album comes out, but will have my wedding after the album comes out. Before the 90 days is over, yes, I will be married. I’m very happy about that because my baby makes me so happy.”</p><p>If all goes according to plan, this will be the first child for Nicki. Petty reportedly has five children and is active in their lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kHJmaXFfZYJwusicoqJlnZ67oraMqaOapqNiwbB50Z6roqqVYsGwecearZ5lm56xtHnWoquhZZuau6%2Bx06FkqZ2kqcZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
