Reddit Theories Explains The Exit</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-10-05</div><p>Why did Alara leave Orville? Reddit discussions provide various theories explaining the potential reason behind her exit from the show.</p><p>With a good IMDb rating and wide public popularity, Orville is one of the best shows out there based on the world of outer space and aliens.</p><p>The show’s story revolves around the crew of a spaceship who embarks on an adventurous journey into the future, 400 years after the present time, and faces various situations. The adventure fiction series first premiered in 2017 and has three seasons.</p><p>Many people follow the show as they like it and are always keen to know more about its casts and other details such as story plots. One of the characters that the fans loved the most was Alara. However, her sudden removal from the show has disappointed many fans who still ponder the reason behind the removal.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-alara-leave-the-orville></span>Why Did Alara Leave The Orville?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alara left Orville to return to her planet, Xelaya, to regain her strength as she was becoming weaker due to the earth’s lower gravity.</p><p>She last appeared in the third episode titled&nbsp;Home&nbsp;in the second season of the TV show. The title is based on Alara’s return to her home planet to regain her sharpness and strength.</p><p>As we all know, she gained superhuman strength because her planet’s gravity is much stronger than the earth’s, and that situation made her powerful on our planet. However, that power was not infinite and depended on her adapted environment.</p><p>Alara spent too much time on the earth, and her body started adopting our planet’s low gravity and surroundings, weakening her power. So, she returned home to reenergize and chose to remain there.</p><p>Screen Rant&nbsp;reports that the medical officer Dr. Claire Finn had developed a treatment to help Alara regain power while remaining on the ship. But she decided to leave anyway, based on the story’s writing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=reddit-theories-on-alara-leaving-orville-explored></span>Reddit Theories On Alara Leaving Orville Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many people have discussed their theories explaining the reason behind Alara leaving Orville.</p><p>Few of them discussed the influence on her abilities due to earth’s surroundings and nature. However, most of them directly connected the exit to the&nbsp;actress, Halston Sage, who played the character. People talked about her personal life and the problems that she might have faced in real life that needed time to fix.</p><p>You can access those theories on Reddit, as many people have discussed her leaving the show. However, only a few fractions of those might be close to the truth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=actress-halston-sage-exit-from-orville-why-did-she-leave></span>Actress Halston Sage Exit From Orville: Why Did She Leave?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The actress Halston Sage, who played Alara on Orville, left the show because the writers decided to end her screen time.</p><p>Her last appearance came in season 2 of the show. Since that screen time, the actress has appeared a few times on guest appearances, but her return as a central character doesn’t seem likely. And the main reason behind such is the writing of the show.</p><p>Halston herself didn’t know why her role was written off. Talking to the Television Critics Association panel in 2019, Sage said it was not her choice to leave the TV show but a story plot that was best for the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYrnqltcNmmKWZopZ6rbHAr5xmrJiaerC%2B1aKjpZ1dp7KlsMitZK2glaS%2FqrHSZpyxqJyWtq%2B%2FjK2fnmWVrba1eZFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
