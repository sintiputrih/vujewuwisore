She stepped into a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheeky bikini</a>, covered in cow print sequins, which she layered with a pair of bottomless blue chaps. Chanel was equally cheeky in her caption, as she shared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the Western look</a> to Instagram on March 28 and wrote, ”I got the horses in the back” 😜🤠🐎🌵🎥.” Chanel proved to be quite the wordsmith, as she’s not only referring to her impressive derriere — there were actual horses in the background, since the photo was shot at a stable.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Chanel is also the master at coordination, as she topped off the look with a pair of blue-bottomed, cow print platforms (yes, they exist). She wore a tight finger curl wig over her long, blonde waves, and the retro ‘do fit the theme of the video’s name: “Old Fashioned.” A single of the same name is also on the way, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>according</a> to <strong>Tony Medina</strong>, Chanel’s hair stylist for the music video. She dressed to theme in an Instagram Story video as well, as the MTV personality was filmed in white booty shorts and a matching star-studded bra and fringe vest. Chanel wore the same outfit, but in all black, while she posed in a town fitting for a classic Western showdown in a photo shared on March 26. We’re counting three costumes total so far!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although Chanel is famously known for hosting&nbsp;Ridiculousness, she’s been on a roll with her music career. She released another music video for her new single, “The Middle,” on Feb. 22, a project that also served as her directorial debut. The style aficionado, known for pushing the boundaries in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>skin-baring pieces</a> and edgy ensembles, even picked out her own outfits for the video!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH10e5FxZpygkaOyrXnWnqqtZZOkrrTAjJujrp1dmLWivNJmmqivXaW%2FqrrTZpmio5mjtm68x6irqGWdqsCqr4yvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
