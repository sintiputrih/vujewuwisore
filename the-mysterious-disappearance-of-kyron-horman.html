According to <a href=#>The Oregonian</a>, a witness came forward with a claim that Terri Horman offered to pay him if he killed her husband, Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, about 6 months before her stepson disappeared. This unidentified person reportedly worked as a landscaper for the Hormans.</p><p dir=ltr>The police followed up on this claim and informed Kaine Horman of the alleged plot. Upon learning this information, Kaine then left the home that he shared with Terri, and took their young daughter with him. Investigators first attempted to get Terri Horman to speak about the incident by sending the landscaper and an undercover police officer to discuss it with her while they recorded the conversation. When that didn't work, they confronted her directly about the allegations, which she has denied.</p><p dir=ltr>After a few months of being separated, Kaine Horman attempted to block his estranged wife from seeing their daughter. In his <a href=#>petition</a> to the court, he claimed that Terri Horman was an "emotionally disturbed individual" and that she was putting her personal needs ahead of their daughter and finding Kyron. He also believes that she is responsible for the disappearance of his son, due to her changing stories, failed polygraph tests, and lack of emotional responses. Kaine then revealed text messages between Terri and his high school friend, Michael Cook, that contained sexually explicit texts and images, in Kaine's pursuit of obtaining full custody of the couple's daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkHJwbXFfqbWmecyyqq2dop68tr%2BMnaCsmaClsqK%2BwKeanmWfm3qsxdGopWagn6e6orqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
