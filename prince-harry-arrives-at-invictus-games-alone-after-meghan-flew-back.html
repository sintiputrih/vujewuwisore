</strong>2024-07-26</div><p class=mol-para-with-font>Buckingham Palace officials were today preparing for further bombshell revelations from Prince Harry after a major US TV network announced that he had given them a sit-down interview during the Invictus Games.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>NBC’s Today show revealed that the Duke of Sussex had spoken to presenter Hoda Kotb while in the Netherlands about ‘the Invictus Games, his surprise visit with the Queen and life with his wife Meghan Markle’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The chat will be previewed on NBC Nightly News tonight, which airs at 11.30pm UK time (6.30pm Eastern Time, in New York) – and then shown in full tomorrow on the Today programme from 12pm UK time (7am Eastern Time).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Palace will be concerned that Harry could make further claims about the Royal Family only a year after his infamous interview to Oprah Winfrey on CBS in which he and Meghan accused unnamed royals of racism.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Duke has a deeply strained relationship with his family – especially his father Prince Charles and brother Prince William – and missed last month’s memorial service at Westminster Abbey for his grandfather Prince Philip.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry’s meeting with the Queen and Charles last Thursday before he arrived in The Hague was supposedly secret, but he has already revealed that it was ‘great to see her’ – and could now give more details about their discussion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Duke has already said that his grandmother ‘had plenty of messages for Team UK’ which he had already passed on and told the BBC yesterday: ‘It was great to see her and I’m sure she would love to be here if she could.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Royal aides will be concerned about details from a private meeting being divulged, which come on top of fears over what could be contained in his forthcoming memoirs and Netflix documenting his every move at the Games.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Duke has already been accused in recent days of using his platform at the Games to promote BetterUp, the California mental health start-up for whom he is ‘chief impact officer’ – after the two announced a partnership.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile today, Harry played table tennis and virtual golf today as his visit to the Games continued alone after his wife Meghan Markle left him in The Hague to fly home to their children Archie and Lilibet in California.&nbsp;</p><img fetchpriority=high

Paralymics table tennis Silver medalist Thomas Schmidberger clutch hands in The Hague today</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This morning, the Duke was seen walking through a backstage area at the Invictus Games, following what was the first time the couple had been seen together publicly on this side of the Atlantic for two years.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry was also seen playing table tennis with Tokyo Paralympics table tennis silver medalist Thomas Schmidberger, gold medalist Valentin Baus and two time Paralympic Competitor Sandra Mikolaschek.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Flanked by his ever-present bodyguard – former US Secret Service agent Christopher Sanchez – Harry walked through the crowds at the Zuiderpark to a tent where visitors can try their luck on a virtual golf course.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was handed a seven iron and guided by an instructor was shown how to correctly hold the club. The Prince jokingly warned people to stand back as he took a swing – and drove his ball a distance of 54ft. The crowd cheered when the screen showed his ball bouncing on to the virtual green.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry, who was casually dressed in black Invictus T-shirt and blue chinos – found his next sport slightly harder. He had called into a tent hosted by the city of Dusseldorf, the next venue for the 2023 Invictus Games.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After chatting with organisers, he had to be persuaded to try his hand at table tennis. One of the men playing attempted to hand him a bat, but the Prince shook his head and repeatedly said no.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As a small crowd urged him to try his luck he reluctantly agreed and joined a wheelchair bound athlete for a quick knock up in a doubles match. He was able to keep the bat as a souvenir when he left the tent.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One of Dusseldorf team said: ‘He said he was looking forward very much to us hosting the games. Here in The Hague they have been a great success, and we will of course want to match that.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry was accompanied on the walkabout in the Zuiderpark by an entourage of nine.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Most of the following him were members of the Archewell Production company, including five women who at time struggled to keep up with the Prince as he strode purposefully through the side attractions at the games.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A Netflix crew were also in attendance and filmed the Prince meeting VIPs and other guests in The Tulip Lounge. Earlier, he had attended a volleyball match and was expected to watch the swimming event.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His wife Meghan, who had been the centre of attention during the first three days of the games, flew home to Los Angeles on a KLM flight from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry and Meghan, who had a Netflix documentary film crew in tow, have been shadowed by Barack Obama’s former bodyguard Mr Sanchez as the row continued over their security arrangements in Britain.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Sanchez protected President Obama and George W Bush over the course of five years’ service. He is director of&nbsp;Texas-based Professional Protection and Investigations, which claims its insurance is ‘above industry standards’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Duke is at the heart of an extraordinary legal wrangle over his security when coming to Britain.&nbsp;He mounted a legal challenge against the Home Office having been told he would no longer be given the ‘same degree’ of personal protective security when visiting from the US, despite claiming he had offered to pay for it himself.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For the visit to Holland, Harry and his wife were given VVIP (very, very important person) status that allowed Dutch royal protection officers to be assigned to them, alongside private security guards who are also protecting them.&nbsp;</p><img

Palace balcony during the Platinum Jubilee celebrations but will not be allowed to have a ‘formal role’ in the celebrations.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If the couple decide to travel to London for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee they will appear at&nbsp;<span style=font-size:18px>family events including the traditional balcony appearance and a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:18px>However, given they are no longer senior working royals they cannot take part in Trooping the Colour or play a central role in any events taking place over the four-day Bank Holiday weekend, the Telegraph reported.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:18px>It comes as the Duke of Sussex broke</span>&nbsp;his silence on his secret ‘olive branch’ meeting with the Queen last week.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry said ‘it was great to see’ his 96-year-old grandmother during a quick stop-off at Windsor Castle – where he also met his father Prince Charles, reportedly for just 15 minutes – before going to Holland for the Invictus Games.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The prince, himself a military veteran&nbsp;<span style=font-size:18px>who founded the event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women in 2014, said his grandmother ‘had plenty of messages for Team UK’ when he met her last week.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added he had passed these onto the team, telling the BBC: ‘So, it was great to see her and I’m sure she would love to be here if she could.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:18px><span style=font-size:16px>Harry and Meghan reportedly promised the Queen that she will get to hug her great-grandchildren Archie and Lilibet ‘in the near future’ during the meeting.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Aides believe that Harry and Meghan’s presence at her traditional Jubilee flypast would mean a lot to Her Majesty, who has yet to meet the couple’s daughter Lilibet and who is learning to live without her husband of seven decades Prince Philip after his death last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It&nbsp;will likely mark the last big family balcony appearance of her reign, which will soon enter its 71st year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, sources warned that the Sussexes’ attendance will have to be carefully managed, and will involve a ‘leap of faith’ from all sides after the couple made a string of damaging claims, including bombshell allegations of racism against an unnamed senior royal made in their Oprah tell-all last year, since they quit royal life and moved to Montecito.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry would&nbsp;also have to backtrack amid a row over his security, after he launched legal action against the Home Office, alleging that he didn’t feel safe bringing his family to the UK following the Government’s decision not to provide them with police protection.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A spokesman for the Sussexes said they were not in a position to
