We do make a living, but we don't need to worry about making a living out of every patient we see."</p><p>In some cases, even making a living is out of reach, like in the anecdote he shared at the 2016 ObesityHelp National Conference. Dr. Nowzaradan revealed that his entire compensation from the insurance company of a more than 800 pound patient was 97 cents.&nbsp;</p><p>And though Nowzaradan is famous, we're not talking about a celebrity doctor here, who breezes in for a cameo then allows his staff to do all of the clinical stuff. This guy puts in hours. Dr. Nowzaradan told Houstonia that he works "12 to 14 hours a day, seven days a week, fitting in between 60 and 80 patients each day."&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and did we mention that as of this writing, he's in his 70s? Think about that the next time you shake your fist at an elderly person behind the wheel, because they could just be exhausted and on the way to their second or third job.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpa39ye8Oim6esXaC7sMOMnaacrJ%2Bnend8j2ajm2WcnrOmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
