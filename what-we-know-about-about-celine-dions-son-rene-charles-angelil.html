The two kept it professional until her 20s. On her 25th birthday, Rene proposed and the two wed the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Growing up, Celine didn’t have much. In fact, her parents used a dresser drawer as a crib because they couldn’t afford an actual crib. She now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has a reported net worth of $800 million</a>, as well as some impressive titles, including best-selling Canadian artist and best-selling artist of all time.</p><p>Thanks to her success, she has been able to give her children everything she didn’t have growing up. At the same time, she's tried her best to make sure that her kids always stay humble. Her eldest son, Rene-Charles, is a true inspiration. He is probably the most humble and down-to-earth celebrity child in Hollywood.</p><p>Here is everything we know about Celine Dion’s eldest son, Rene-Charles Angelil.</p><h2 id=during-his-teen-years-he-was-more-focused-on-his-schooling-then-hollywood><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>During His Teen Years, He Was More Focused On His Schooling Then Hollywood</span></h2><p>It’s not uncommon for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity kids to eventually rule Hollywood</a>. They often become famous and powerful&nbsp;at some point in their lives, just like their celeb parents. Some even make a name for themselves before they hit puberty - Miley Cyrus is one example. Rene-Charles was the complete opposite. He cared more about his schooling than making it big in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-played-hockey-in-high-school><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Played Hockey In High School</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One thing to know about Celine’s eldest son, Rene</a>, is that he spent his school years living in Las Vegas with his mom and two brothers, but he never forgot his Canadian heritage. Canada is big on hockey - while in high school, Rene played ice hockey for the Nevada Storm Midget AA league.</p><h2 id=he-presented-his-mother-with-her-2016-billboard-icon-award-at-the-billboard-music-awards><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Presented His Mother With Her 2016 Billboard Icon Award At The Billboard Music Awards</span></h2><p>Back in 2016, Celine Dion got the surprise of her life during the 2016 Billboard Music Awards. The surprise brought tears of joy to her eyes. She walked on stage and saw her son -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rene-Charles surprised her with the Billboard Icon Award</a>.</p><p>Only a few other celebs have been gifted with this award, including Jennifer Lopez, Neil Diamond, Stevie Wonder, and Prince. Being able to receive the reward from her son was so special. It was a moment she and Rene-Charles will never forget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-is-down-to-earth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Is Down-To-Earth</span></h2><p>A lot of children that grow up in Hollywood love the spotlight and embrace their celebrity status, thanks to their parents. Rene doesn't need that kind of attention. He is down to earth and you'd really never know that he has a celebrity as a parent...let alone Celine Dion.</p><h2 id=he-got-to-meet-rihanna-as-a-teenager><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Got To Meet Rihanna As A Teenager</span></h2><p>While a teen, Rene was more focused on his schooling then being a big-time celebrity offspring. Like any teen, though, he wouldn't pass up the chance to meet certain big-time celebrities. While surprising his mother with her 2016 Billboard Music Award, Rene was able to meet Rihanna and even captured the moment with an Instagram photo. In the pic, as you can see, he is grinning from ear to ear.</p><h2 id=he-is-strong-like-his-mother><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Is Strong Like His Mother</span></h2><p>Celine Dion went through a lot in her life. She grew up in poverty, was made fun of for how she looked and struggled at the beginning of her career. All her struggles made her who she is now. Rene’s struggles have also made him strong. Losing his father at such a young age, Rene had to grow up quickly...and be a rock for his mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-is-a-rapper><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Is A Rapper</span></h2><p>At the young age of 17, Rene decided that he was going to follow in his mother's footsteps by trying for a career in music. Maybe he doesn’t really look it but he is a rapper. Ever heard of the rapper, Big Tip? Well, that’s his stage name and he released his first two songs, which were recorded in his home studio. This studio is located in the garage of his family home in Las Vegas.</p><h2 id=he-didn-t-tell-his-mother-about-his-first-rap-songs-until-after-they-hit-number-one-on-the-canadian-soundcloud-r-amp-b-charts><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Didn't Tell His Mother About His First Rap Songs Until After They Hit Number One On&nbsp;The Canadian SoundCloud R&B Charts</span></h2><p>Unlike most teenagers, Rene has a mother who is one of the world’s best-selling artists of all time. Like most teenagers, though, he keeps things from his parents every now and again. When Rene recorded his first two rap songs, he left his mother out of the loop at first - he only told her when they hit No.1 and No.2 on the Canadian SoundCloud R&B charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-doesn-t-want-to-gain-fame-by-piggybacking-off-his-mother-s-name-he-wants-to-do-it-on-his-own><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Doesn't Want To Gain Fame By Piggybacking Off His Mother's Name, He Wants To Do It On His Own</span></h2><p>There is two types of celebrity kids in Hollywood - those that use their parents' fame to jump-start careers of their own, and those that break away from their parents to make a name for themselves. Rene is the second type. He could have used his mom’s connections to help boost his rap career; instead, he wanted to prove to himself that he could do it on his own...and he succeeded.</p><h2 id=he-just-celebrated-his-19th-birthday><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Just Celebrated His 19th Birthday</span></h2><p>We have watched Rene grow up and become a very handsome and talented young man. It’s hard to believe that he isn’t the little boy we saw clutching his mother's hand in paparazzi pictures anymore. He’s now a 19-year-old adult who is just starting out in life. In January 2020, Celine took to Instagram to pen a heartfelt message to her eldest son. She also shared an adorable baby pic of him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Celebs Celine Dion Is Surprisingly Friends With</a></span></p><h2 id=his-mother-refused-to-allow-him-to-become-man-of-the-house-after-his-father-s-passing><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>His Mother Refused To Allow Him To Become "Man Of The House" After His Father's Passing</span></h2><p>When Celine Dion’s husband passed away in 2016, her children were still young. Rene was just 15 years old, while her twin boys were only six years old. Celine was determined not to make her eldest son feel like he had to take up the mantle of “man of the house.” She wanted him to enjoy his childhood, focus on his schooling, and experience everything that typical teenagers get to experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celine Dion Owns More Than Mansions...She Also Has A Shoe Warehouse</a></span></p><h2 id=he-wears-nice-clothes-and-does-his-hair-when-he-knows-he-will-be-recognized><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Wears Nice Clothes and Does His Hair When He Knows He Will Be Recognized</span></h2><p>Having a famous parent like Celine Dion doesn’t come without some kind of fan attention every now and again, though. Celine even told Hello! Canada, “If he comes to a show, he knows he is going to be asked for pictures and autographs. He spends a lot of time fixing his hair so he’s ready. He has business savvy in him.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos That Change The Way We See Celine Dion</a></span></p><h2 id=he-gave-a-heartfelt-speech-at-his-father-s-funeral><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Gave A Heartfelt Speech At His Father's Funeral</span></h2><p>After the passing of his father in 2016, hundreds of people came out to Montreal’s Notre-Dame Basilica to show support and say goodbye. Many spoke at the podium, to pay their respects and share memories with friends and family. It was Rene-Charles’ speech that really opened the flood gates for Celine Dion. She even told People, “I could almost hear his knee-caps shaking. I was so proud of him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadpool Performs A Hilarious Interpretive Dance In Celine Dion's Latest Music Video</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMmpmoraRisKa4yKecZpyZpLu0edKopWaqlaOybq%2FHmqmlnaNirq%2BzxKWgpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
