But fundamentally we know we have the same destination.”</p><p>“We know where we’re headed, and it’s good. And we know we’ll get there together,” the&nbsp;United 93 star explained. The happy pair share three children — sons August, 12, and Andrew, 7, and adopted daughter, Amaya, 8. The couple met on set, when Peter guest-starred on SVU in 2002. This isn’t the first time that the couple has opened up about their love and their family — Mariska once revealed just how much <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is all about her loved ones</a>, especially her kids.</p><p>“The thing that’s made me a better parent is my kids. Because they taught me to really listen,” the popular TV star said. “My husband is my North Star, and my kids are my teachers. Peter and I, we’re so different that it’s been amazing how we complement each other. He knows everything I don’t.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mariska-Hargitay-Peter-Hermann3.jpg><p>“The beauty is that families are made in so many different ways, and that was my reality as a child. Growing up, my family was made in such an interesting and unique way, and now I have that with my own family, and so I understand it. It’s been amazing,” Mariska said.</p><p>It’s always great to see a happy family!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuho6CubrTAq56irJGueqK6w2annqyVp3qpsdGmmKemXaeyt7HApWSknaliwbB5kG5ksp2Rp3qurdGroJqflWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
