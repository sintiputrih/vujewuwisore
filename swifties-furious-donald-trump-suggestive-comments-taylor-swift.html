I find her very beautiful," he stated. However, he had a problem with her political inclinations. "I think she's liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump," he lamented.

"<strong>She is liberal, or is that just an act?</strong>" he asked the editor during their interview. "She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal."</p><p>Swifties reacted almost instantly, angry with the former president for dragging the singer into a political debate and reducing her to her looks.

'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? <strong>We will vote you out in November</strong>," she ranted.</p><p>She also, in 2018, wrote about the midterm elections and implied she regretted not speaking up in 2016.</p><p>"<strong>In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions</strong>, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">she wrote on Instagram</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG.
