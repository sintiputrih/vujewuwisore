It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of her wealth is as much as $8 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2016, accumulated during her 10 year career.</p><h3>Kelli Giddish Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the girl was raised in Cumming, the daughter of Charles and Nita Giddish, very close to her maternal grandmother Dosia Hildebrand and paternal grandfather Ralph, a veteran of World War II. At the age of six, she began playing in theatrical productions. She eventually matriculated from Forsyth Central High School in 1998, and later graduated with honours majoring in Arts from the University of Evansville in Indiana. She was also part of the University softball team. She then moved to New York to begin her acting career.</p><p>In 2005, she landed her first role in the soap opera “All My Children”, in which she had the regular role of Diana “Di” Henry, playing the role until her departure from the series in late 2007. This was followed by supporting roles in several movies – “Witches of the Caribbean” (2005), “Death in Love” (2008), and “The Understudy” (2008) as well as guest appearances in several television series, including “Damages” (2007) and “Life on Mars – Trapped in the 70’s” (2009). Between 2006 and 2009, Giddish also played the role of Courtney in the web series “The Burg” which is thirteen episodes long. In 2010, the actress got the lead roles in two television series. In the spring of 2010, she created the role in the mystery detective series “Past Life” as a psychologist Kate McGinn as well as in the autumn of 2010 she appeared in the police drama series “Chase” in the role of the USA Marshal Annie Frost. However, both series were cancelled due to poor viewer ratings. In 2011, Giddish played the small supporting role of Sophia Russo in the second season of “The Good Wife”. She was invited to join the main cast of the above mentioned series, yet Giddish rejected the invitation in favour of the regular role of Detective Amanda Rollins in the crime series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” (2011 – present), and then the same role she landed in the episodes of other series including “Chicago Fire” (2014) and “Chicago P.D.” (2014 – 2015). It should also be noted that she created the role of Tiny in the feature film “Breathless” (2012).

In the autumn of the same year their son, Ludo Faulborn was born.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.338345864662><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kelli Giddish</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 13, 1980</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Cumming, Georgia, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>129 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Television actress</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Forsyth Central High School, University of Evansville in Indiana</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Lawrence Faulborn (m. 2015-)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Ludo Faulborn</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Charles Giddish, Nita Giddish</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Eli Giddish</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Гиддиш, Келли</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/thekelligiddish</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30508474576271><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/kelli.giddish.a.rollins/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm1534207</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>“Witches of the Caribbean” (2005), “Death in Love” (2008), “The Understudy” (2008), “Breathless” (2012)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Law & Order: SVU” (2011 – present), “All My Children” (2005-2007), “Damages” (2007), “Life on Mars - Trapped in the 70's” (2009), “The Burg”, “Chase” (2010-2011), “Chicago Fire” (2014), “Chicago P.D.” (2014 – 2015)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=21.859335038363><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Gave birth to her 1st child at age 35, a son named Ludo Faulborn in October 2015.
