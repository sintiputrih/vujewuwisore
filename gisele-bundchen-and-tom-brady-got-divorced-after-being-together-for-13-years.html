The announcement of their divorce follows several reports about their breakup.&nbsp;Bundchen announced their “amicable divorce” on Instagram and said that the couple would continue to co-parent their children:</p><p>“With great thanks for our time together, Tom and I have settled our divorce peacefully.” My first focus has always been and will always be our children, whom I adore. We will continue to co-parent in order to provide them with the love, care, and attention they so richly deserve.”</p><p>Brady expressed similar feelings in his own statement, saying:</p><p>“After 13 years of marriage, my wife and I just completed our divorce from one another.” We reached this conclusion peacefully and gratefully for the time we spent together.”</p><p>Prior to the news, TMZ said that Gisele Bundchen filed for divorce in Florida on Friday, and Brady chose not to dispute the divorce.&nbsp;According to the magazine, attorneys from both parties have been working on a settlement since October and have apparently struck an agreement on property and child custody. According to court filings, Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady opted to divorce because their marriage was “irretrievably destroyed.” The couple has also filed settlement agreements with the court, although the terms are said to be private.</p><p>According to the documents, Bundchen and Brady finished a “Parent Education and Family Stabilization Course,” and their marital status has been changed to “single and unmarried.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=de>Tom Brady announced that he and Gisele Bündchen divorced: <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QHXdHT9Baw</a></p><p>— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 28, 2022</a></p><h2>Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady’s relationship problems are said to have started when the latter “un-retired” from the NFL.</h2><p>Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen were once labeled the entertainment and sports industry’s power couple. The couple started dating in 2006 and married in February 2009.&nbsp;They eventually had two children, a son Benjamin (12), and a daughter Vivian (9). However, after Brady’s temporary retirement from the NFL earlier this year, tales of purported “tension” between the pair started to surface.&nbsp;Brady first declared his retirement from the NFL after 22 years, but he returned to the field 40 days later.</p><p>In September, a source informed US Weekly that Gisele Bundchen was dissatisfied with Brady’s professional decision. They stated:</p><p>“Gisele was furious when Tom resigned from the NFL after just a few months.” “There is a conflict between them.”</p><p>According to the source, the quarterback is “doing all he can to make it up to” his wife:</p><p>“They’re going through it and attempting to get to the other side.”</p><p>According to another source, Brady’s professional life has impacted his personal life, and Bundchen is “frustrated” and “spending time apart” from her husband:</p><p>“Returning to Tampa after retirement placed a burden on his personal life.” Gisele is fed up with his work taking precedence over their family, who has always supported him.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gisele-Bundchen.jpg alt="Gisele Bundchen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tom Brady took another leave of absence in August to “handle personal concerns,” and when he returned, he addressed the situation:</p><p>“Everyone is coping with various issues, and we all face distinct obstacles in our lives.” Man, I’m 45 years old. There’s a lot going on, so you simply have to attempt to figure it out as best you can. You know, it’s a never-ending process.”</p><p>In 2020, the NFL player told Howard Stern that his work often interfered with his connections with his family:</p><p>“[Gisele] didn’t feel like I was contributing to the family.”</p><p>Page Six reported last month that Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady had a “epic argument” and that the former fled their Tampa family property for a vacation to Costa Rica:</p><p>“Tom and Gisele are fighting right now… His choice to resign has caused strife in the marriage. Gisele has always been the one in charge of the children. He had promised to retire to spend more time with his family, but then he changed his mind.”</p><p>Shortly later, a source told People that the pair were going through a “difficult patch” in their relationship:</p><p>“There’s a lot of anxiety. She was overjoyed when he announced his retirement, and she was furious when he changed his mind. They’re going through a hard period. But I know they’re trying to figure it out, or at least he is, and make it work.”</p><p></p><p>Gisele Bundchen rushed to Twitter to express her support for Tom Brady’s first game of the season, amid the lingering rumors. Bundchen told Elle that same month that she did her share to help her husband:</p><p>“I’ve done my bit by being there for [Tom].” I relocated to Boston with the intention of establishing a safe haven and a loving atmosphere for my children to grow up in, as well as to be there to support him and his aspirations.”</p><p>The Brazilian beauty went on to say that she is “fulfilled” as a mother and wife and is looking forward to discovering her own purpose:</p><p>“It makes me glad to watch my children achieve and grow into the lovely little beings that they are, and to see him succeed and be content in his profession.” I feel like I’ve done a decent job with it at this point in my life. I have a long list of things I need to and want to accomplish. “At 42, I feel more engaged in my mission.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gisele-Bundchen-2.jpg alt="Gisele Bundchen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Meanwhile, according to another insider, Brady and Bundchen have been living apart for a month and the latter is “sad” by the situation:</p><p>“Gisele had been telling Tom for a long time that he needs to spend more time with his family, and when he retired, she felt she got what she wanted.” She was upset when Tom opted to return to the NFL. Gisele is devastated.”</p><p>Earlier this month, various media publications claimed that the couple had hired divorce attorneys. On Friday, Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady announced their divorce and confirmed their separation.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGieoquVobJurtSnm5yglaN6orrDZquopV2Xv6Kw2GaeqKxdmba3u9GcnJ1lkZvBpr6Mm5yippdiwbCzxK2fnqpdm7yzeZBsZLKdkafAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
