Regardless of their status, these celebrities are all compensated for their time and efforts on the show.</p><h2 id=how-much-do-celebrities-make-on-the-masked-singer>How Much Do Celebrities Make On The Masked Singer?</h2><p>It's no secret that The Masked Singer has become one of the most popular and talked-about shows on television, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with millions tuning in each week</a> to watch celebrities don elaborate costumes and sing their hearts out. But what many fans may not realize is just how much these famous faces are getting paid for their appearances on the show. From A-list actors to reality TV stars, the lineup of celebrities who have graced The Masked Singer stage is as diverse as it is impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, appeared on the show back in 2020. Despite her lack of experience in the music industry, Palin wowed audiences with her rendition of "Baby Got Back" while dressed as a giant bear, <a href=#>although not everyone was a fan of her highly-publicized appearance</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Sarah-Palin-as-Bear.jpg><p>While it's unclear exactly how much she earned for her appearance, Complex estimated that she could have made upwards of $250,000 for just a few minutes on stage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'The Masked Singer' Judge Storms Off As Rudy Giuliani Is Unmasked</a></span></p><p>Another surprise contestant on The Masked Singer was comedian Drew Carey, best known for hosting game shows like The Price Is Right and Whose Line Is It Anyway?. Dressed as a giant snail, Carey delivered a memorable performance of "I Will Survive" before ultimately being unmasked. Though his exact salary remains unknown, it's safe to say that he likely earned a hefty sum for his time on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, not all celebrities who appear on The Masked Singer are necessarily looking for a big payday. Some simply enjoy the challenge of performing in front of a live audience while disguised in an elaborate costume. Take actress Raven-Symoné, for example; though she has already achieved fame through roles in shows like That's So Raven and The Cosby Show, she jumped at the chance to appear on The Masked Singer as Black Widow.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>That's So Raven Has Some Of The Most Controversial Scenes In Disney Channel History</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun has reported that salaries and bonuses for stars on The Masked Singer can range from modest to astronomical</a>, depending on factors such as their level of fame, their negotiating power, and the terms of their contracts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/amber-riley-and-nick-cannon-on-the-masked-singer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it's not just salaries that make up the financial picture for Masked Singer contestants. Many stars also receive bonuses based on how far they make it in the competition. For example, if a celebrity makes it to the final round or wins the entire competition, they may receive an additional payout beyond their initial salary. These bonuses can add up quickly and provide even more incentive for celebrities to participate in the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Poorest Celebrity Contestants On 'The Masked Singer' Ranked</a></span></p><p>Of course, there are other factors at play when it comes to how much money celebrities make from The Masked Singer. Some stars may negotiate additional perks such as transportation or accommodations during filming that further add to their bottom line. Additionally, some celebrities may use appearances on shows like this as an opportunity to promote upcoming projects or raise awareness about charitable causes they support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-do-judges-make-from-hosting-the-masked-singer>How Much Do Judges Make From Hosting The Masked Singer?</h2><p>It's no secret that judges on The Masked Singer make a pretty penny for their role on the popular reality show. However, what many viewers may not realize is that judge compensation can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors.</p><p>For starters, the level of celebrity status and industry experience of each judge can impact their pay grade. A-list celebrities like Jennifer Lopez or Katy Perry would likely command a much higher salary than up-and-coming performers or reality stars with less name recognition. Additionally, judges who have previously worked in the entertainment industry may also receive higher compensation due to their prior experience and connections within the field.</p><p>Generally, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">judges and host Nick Cannon are reported as making $250,000 per episode of the show</a>. With those estimates, it's kind of bizarre that <a href=#>Cannon only has a net worth of $3 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/how-nick-cannon-almost-lost-his-life-over-a-decade-again-because-of-a-rare-diagnosis.jpg><p>Another factor that can impact judge compensation is network budget constraints. While shows like The Masked Singer are undoubtedly lucrative for networks, they still have to balance their budgets and ensure they're getting the most bang for their buck when it comes to hiring talent. As such, some judges may be offered lower salaries if network executives feel they can't justify paying them more given the show's overall budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are other considerations as well - such as whether judges are expected to participate in other promotional activities or if they have any contractual obligations beyond simply appearing on screen during episodes of The Masked Singer. All these factors combined mean that there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to how much judges make from hosting The Masked Singer - it truly varies depending on a multitude of factors.</p><p>Despite this variability though, one thing is clear: being a judge on one of television's most popular reality shows certainly pays off handsomely. With the potential for high salaries and exposure to millions of viewers, it's no wonder that this show continues to attract top talent season after season.</p><p>One reason why judges earn more than contestants is simply because of what their role entails. While contestants only have to perform once or twice a week (depending on how far they make it in the competition), judges are present for every episode. This means they have to spend hours watching rehearsals, preparing for each performance, and providing insightful feedback to each contestant after their performance is over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydpmablaGyo77IraCeq12irqyxjKilZqyYmnqurdKknJ1lo567qLHRZpqopaCWv6awjK2mZqKlmbSmv4ysmKWZoq58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
