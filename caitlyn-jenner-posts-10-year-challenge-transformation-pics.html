Caitlyn Jenner participated in the fad that’s taking over the internet — the “10-Year Challenge,” in which people are posting transformation pictures of themselves from 2009 vs 2019 — and totally won the experiment.
Jenner, 69, posted before-and-after photos on Instagram that showed her several years prior to her transition, compared to a more recent snapshot. “THAT is a #10YearChallenge Be authentic to yourself,” she captioned the post on Tuesday, January 15, adding a purple heart emoji."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She <a href=#>opened up about the surgery</a> during a 20/20 interview with <a href=#><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> in April 2017 and explained, “I wasn’t less a woman the day before I had the surgery than the day after the surgery, because that did not define who I am as a human being.”</p><p>Jenner was married to <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> for 22 years before they <a href=#>announced their separation</a> in October 2013. While the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 63, told Us Weekly there was “no animosity” between them following their split, their relationship took a turn for the worse after the release of the former triathlete’s memoir, The Secrets of My Life.</p><p>Caitlyn’s former stepdaughters, <a href=#><strong>Kim</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Khloé</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, were also upset because Caitlyn allegedly “lied” about what was going to be in the book and didn’t tell them about the surgery.</p><p>“I have always had Caitlyn’s back,” the KKW Beauty founder, 38, said on the E! series&nbsp;in October 2017. “<a href=#>She is a liar</a>. She is not a good person.”</p><p>In January 2018, Caitlyn explained that she purposely didn’t tell the Kardashians about her gender confirmation surgery because she “<a href=#>didn’t trust them</a>” to keep it quiet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I didn’t tell anybody. Why? It’s none of their business,” she said on <a href=#><strong>Piers Morgan</strong></a>’s Life Stories at the time. “I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half … I didn’t want them to leak it to the press. And there was no reason for them to know about it.”</p><p>Kim, Kourtney, 39, and Khloé, 34, appeared on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a> on Monday, January 14, however, and admitted that their feud with Caitlyn is over. “We saw her on Christmas Eve,” the Selfish author told host <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>. “It’s, like … new year, drama free. That’s, like, our motto this year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZmpubq6jKOcp6aVp3qxu9KtqmZpYGLGpq3RZpqhmZyhsq%2BzxGarq5meqLOwvsyaq6KnnmK9qq%2FSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
