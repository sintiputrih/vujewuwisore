Considering the monarch's lifelong passion for protecting the environment, it's natural that he would choose to make some eco-friendly sartorial choices.
Eco-friendly or not, the king's coronation day look was far from plain. Upon arrival and departure, Charles wore two different grand robes, per royal tradition. Then, during the ceremony, Charles reused golden vestments which have been worn for nearly every coronation since 1821, including the Colobium Sindonis, the Supertunica, the Imperial Mantle, the Coronation Sword Belt and the Coronation Glove."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This particular piece of clothing has a sentimental meaning to Charles, as it was previously worn by his grandfather, George VI, during his 1937 coronation.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Supertunica</h2><img alt="coronation vestments unveiled by buckingham palace" title="Coronation Vestments Unveiled By Buckingham Palace" width=3784 height=2523 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/caroline-de-guitaut-deputy-surveyor-of-the-kings-works-of-news-photo-1683349193.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This sleeved gold coat was originally made in 1911 for George Vi's coronation. George VI and Queen Elizabeth II subsequently wore it at their own crowning ceremonies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though it is a relatively modern piece compared to other <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a43670669/king-charles-queen-camilla-coronation-regalia-facts/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="coronation regalia" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">coronation regalia</a>, it is designed in the same style as coats from medieval coronations, which is in turn influenced by priestly and religious vestments.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This Supertunica features goldwork techniques and embroidery, which was originally completed in 1911 by the Ladies Work Society.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Imperial Mantle</h2><img alt="london, england may 01 the coronation vestments, comprising of the imperial mantle left and the supertunica right, displayed in the throne room at buckingham palace on may 1, 2023 in london, england the vestments will be worn by king charles iii during his coronation at westminster abbey on may 6 photo by victoria jones poolgetty images" title="Coronation Vestments Unveiled By Buckingham Palace" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1252462564-6455deecf0ef4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">VICTORIA JONES</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Worn over the Supertunica, the Imperial Mantle appears like a robe. It's composed of cloth of gold, gold, silver and silk thread, silk, gold bullion fringe, and a gold clasp. Additionally, symbolic shapes cover the surface of the Imperial Mantle, including roses, thistles, shamrocks, crowns, eagles, and fleurs-de-lis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This piece was originally created for George IV's 1821 coronation. It is the oldest amongst the coronation vestments.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Coronation Sword Belt</h2><img alt="britain royals coronation king preparations" title=BRITAIN-ROYALS-CORONATION-KING-PREPARATIONS width=3936 height=2624 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-coronation-sword-belt-which-forms-part-of-the-news-photo-1683349124.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">VICTORIA JONES</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also known as the Girdle, the Coronation Sword Belt wraps around the Supertunica, with the Jewelled Sword of Offering then fastened at the monarch's waist. Traditionally, this piece is made anew for each coronation, but Charles has instead chosen to reuse the same Sword Belt that his grandfather, George VI, wore during his 1937 ceremony. This one features cloth of gold, red silk, and a gold buckle and clip.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Coronation Glove</h2><img alt="coronation vestments unveiled by buckingham palace" title="Coronation Vestments Unveiled By Buckingham Palace" width=3936 height=2624 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-coronation-gauntlet-glove-which-forms-part-of-the-news-photo-1683349173.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Coronation Glove, also known as the gauntlet, is worn on the monarch's right hand to hold the Sovereign's Sceptre during the moment he is crowned. Like the Coronation Sword Belt, Charles chose to reuse the hand piece that his grandfather, George VI, wore during his own coronation in 1937, rather than have one made entirely new.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This piece is made up of white leather, and further features gilt metal thread embroidery depicting the national emblems of the Tudor Rose, thistle, shamrock, oak leaves, and acorns. On the back of the glove's hand, there is an embroidered ducal coronet in red velvet above the coat of arms of the family of the Dukes of Newcastle.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Robe of Estate</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To leave Westminster Abbey, Charles put on this purple silk velvet robe that was, again, once worn by George VI. It includes elegant gold embroidery.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
