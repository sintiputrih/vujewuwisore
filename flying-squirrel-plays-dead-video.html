The rodent may be seen in the video enacting its own terrible dying scene.</span></p><p><span>Let’s go over what happened in detail, how the dramatic rodent created its own horrific death scene and nearly framed its owner.</span></p><h2><span>Flying Squirrel Faked Death Video</span></h2><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-49332 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flying-Squirrel-Plays-Dead-Video.png alt="Flying Squirrel Plays Dead Video" width=702 height=492 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-49332 class=wp-caption-text>Flying Squirrel Plays Dead Video</p><p><span>The viral video, which was allegedly shot in Thailand, captures every detail of a flying squirrel’s dramatic narrative of its own terrible demise.</span></p><p><strong><span>SEE ALSO: <span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mikayla Campinos Tiktok Videos</a></span></span></strong></p><p><span>The astute rodent begins by approaching a broom and dustpan in the kitchen. The rodent appeared to be thinking, “Oh, this is it.” Then, let the cleaning item fall to the ground, sprawling out on the floor.</span></p><p><span>However, the squirrel sees that the broom was ineffective as a realistic murder weapon and chooses to try a different approach. The squirrel contemplates numerous poses while snuggling beneath the broom and lays the brush across its body.</span></p><p><span>Finally, it opens its arms wide and positions the broom across its breast, acting like a victim waiting for someone to notice.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, its owner was filming every step of the dramatic scene. Otherwise, people may believe the squirrel perished as a result of its owner’s carelessness.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, the Oscar-winning rodent occasionally acts out of character to test whether anyone has figured out its deceit.</span></p><p><span>The video, which was previously thought to have been posted on June 3 by an anonymous Thai person, was uploaded by Canadian user @BirrelleBee.</span></p><span data-mce-type=bookmark class=mce_SELRES_start></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGidpbGZo7Ruv9CuoKuqlaF6sbjAsqpmnJWWsW7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
