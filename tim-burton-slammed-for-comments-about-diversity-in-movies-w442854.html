“Nowadays, people are talking about it more,” Burton, 58, told Bustle of diversity in films. “Things either call for things, or they don’t."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I remember back when I was a child watching The Brady Bunch and they started to get all politically correct. Like, OK, let’s have an Asian child and a black. I used to get more offended by that than just … I grew up watching blaxploitation movies, right? And I said, that’s great. I didn’t go like, OK, there should be more white people in these movies.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span><b>Samuel L. Jackson </b>— the only nonwhite actor in <i>Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children,</i> which also stars <b>Allison Janney</b> and <b>Judi Dench</b> — came to Burton’s defense.</span></p><p>“I had to go back in my head and go, how many black characters have been in Tim Burton movies?” Jackson said. “And I may have been the first, I don’t know, or the most prominent in that particular way, but it happens the way it happens. I don’t think it’s any fault of his or his method of storytelling, it’s just how it’s played out. Tim’s a really great guy.”</p><p>Still, it was too little, too late. Twitter users attacked Burton — known for beloved films including <i>Beetlejuice</i>, <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> and<i> Alice Through The Looking Glass&nbsp;</i>— and his views on diversity.</p><p>“He’s just one of the many directors who think that for a world to be magical and fantastical it must be white,” one user wrote of Burton, whose name began trending on the social media site.</p><p>Quipped another, “Its fascinating that Tim Burton has a huge imagination in the rendering of his films, but a Asian kid in Miss Peregrine is a stretch for him.”</p><p>Read on for more reactions:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you find out why Tim Burton is trending…… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RFGuDJatVF</a></p><p>— Heather Matarazzo (@HeatherMatarazz) <a href=#>September 30, 2016</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait, you’re saying Tim Burton, who casts the same 2 actors in every movie, doesn’t think diversity is necessary?</p><p>— (((OhNoSheTwitnt))) (@OhNoSheTwitnt) <a href=#>September 29, 2016</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tim Burton’s lack of diversity comes from his insistence that all of his characters be pale.
