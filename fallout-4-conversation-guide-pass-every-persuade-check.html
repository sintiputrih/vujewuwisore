Saying the right thing at the right time can unlock additional content, change entire missions, or alter the outcome of important events in the story.</p><p>Even more important than regular conversations are the Persuade options, which perform a check on your character and a random die roll to see if you pass. These can really change things for the better, or make your situation even worse. There’s some tricks to the system that will help you make it through, so here’s a quick guide for how to pass ever persuade option.</p><p>Just so we’re on the same page, let me describe what the persuasion options are within Fallout 4’s conversation system. Normally when speaking with another character you will be presented with four options of what to say. These should be green, but if you need to persuade then they’ll look different. They will be highlighted in yellow, orange, or red depending on the difficulty. If you have these options and want to pick them, you’ll want to read on for the tips on how to pass almost every time.</p><p>The first and most important tip also comes with a big caveat. It’s a bit of a cheat, though it works surprisingly well, so you might find yourself OK with fudging the rules a bit. This tip essentially boils down to save and load if the persuasion check fails. Even inside of a conversation you can quicksave using the F5 button on PC (not sure if there is a button on Xbox One or PS4). Once you see that yellow, orange, or red just quicksave and choose it. If it fails you can load that save and try again. This kind of defeats the purpose of building up your character, and definitely breaks immersion, but if you really have to pass the check this is one way to do it.</p><p>Now on to some more legitimate ways to boost your chances. Persuasion checks are referencing your Charisma stat, along with various perks associated with it. You can get perks, such as Lady Killer or Black Widow that raise the chances of passing when speaking with a member of the opposite sex. You can also just raise your Charisma, which should help immensely.</p><p>Even without maxing out your Charisma skill, there’s one other way to help. Certain clothes will give you a boost to Charisma, such as the red dress, which gives it two extra levels. Once you find something that boosts your Charisma just carry it around with you. If you get into a conversation that needs to do a persuasion check you can look away and pull out your Pip-Boy and swap clothes. Throw on the red dress or whatever you have that raises Charisma (even if you’re a male you can wear the dress) and get back into the conversation by looking directly at the other character.</p><p>Using these tips you should be able to pass any persuade check within Fallout 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZp%2BZnKG8tsCMbWScp56rsrO%2FwK2gqKZdnMKqsMRmp5qro2Kyt7HRsmSpnaKowqKwxGaaoZ2ToHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
