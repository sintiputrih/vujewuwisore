The team, which also includes WNBA stars <b><a href=#>Diana Taurasi</a></b> and <a href=#><b>Brittney Griner</b></a>, has been busy preparing for the Olympics while juggling their professional schedules. In a rare moment of downtime, the 35-year-old Seattle Storm player shared a list of 25 interesting facts about herself exclusively with <i>Us Weekly</i>.</p><p>1. I collect mugs from my travels.</p><p>2. My favorite karaoke songs are "Real Love" by <a href=#><b>Mary J. Blige</b></a> and "Humpty Dance" by Digital Underground.</p><p>3. I love to go bowling and regularly break 200.</p><p>4. I hate sharks and seaweed, so I never go too far out in the ocean.</p><p>5. I wear #10 because my sister and I are both born in October.</p><p>6. I was anti-Twitter when it first came out and didn't join that or Instagram until 2013.</p><p>8. I had my tongue pierced in college but another teammate of mine, who had hers pierced too, got caught by our coaches (we weren't allowed to have that), and so I got scared and took it out.</p><p>9. To this day, I don't think my coaches ever knew.</p><p>10. I host a parody/spin-off of <a href=#><b>Zach Galifianakis</b></a>'s <i>Between Two Ferns</i> called <i>Between Two Birds</i>. So far I've only had my Seattle Storm teammates on, but I'd love to branch out.</p><p>11. I am an investor in three restaurants in Boston: Five Horses Tavern, Five Horses South and Worden Hall. I also invest in two of <b>Geno Auriemma</b>'s (my college coach at University of Connecticut) restaurants.</p><p>12. For two years I went to high school with <a href=#><b>Natalie Portman</b></a>. That’s my true claim to fame.</p><p>13. I'm the fourth most famous person to attend Syosset High School behind Natalie, <a href=#><b>Judd Apatow</b></a> and <b></b><a href=#><b>Idina Menzel</b></a>.</p><p>14. My mother is Christian. My father is Jewish. I graduated from a Catholic High School and I have Israeli citizenship.</p><p>15. My sister is five years older and when we were younger she used to "time me" so I'd go get her things. This continued until the day I figured it out, and when she asked me to get her a drink, I put soap in it. That ended that.</p><span class=caption></span><p><span>16. When I was 5 years old I went through a kleptomaniac phase (all harmless things, like my sister's glasses and my mom's keys, but still).</span></p><p>17. I also went through a bathing suit phase where I had to have one under all my clothes, at all times. I was 4.</p><p>18. Soccer was actually my first love but eventually basketball took that over.</p><p>19. The first time I was ever asked for my autograph was when I was in sixth grade. My Catholic youth organization team played at halftime of a St. Johns/UConn women's basketball game and afterwards a security guard asked me. Who knew I would end up there.</p><p>20. When I first got to Seattle, I was walking around downtown and got stopped by a cop for jaywalking. He let me off with a warning, but I quickly realized I wasn't in New York anymore.</p><p>21. I recently bought a record player, and now my favorite pastime is checking out record stores in Seattle.</p><p>22. I'm allergic to cats, some dogs, certain nuts and fruit with skin.</p><p>23. My musical preference is hip-hop and I would love to be on <i>Lip Sync Battle</i>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. My favorite basketball shoe of all time is the Uptempo by Nike, hands down.</p><p>25. My favorite pre- and post-game drink is Vitargo. Best I've ever used.</p><p><i>The Rio Olympics begin August 5 and will be streamed live on <a href=#>NBCOlympics.com</a> and on the NBC Sports app. The Rio Paralympics begin September 7 and will be streamed live on <a href=#>TeamUSA.org</a>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaopKmivaqvjJuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtmp6WZqZq%2Fbr%2FUnmSboaKZenOBjK2foqaXqHq6u9Rmm6impGK4r7vWZq5ta2Brf3Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
