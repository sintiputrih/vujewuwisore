Jenna and twin sister Barbara Bush first caught the nation’s attention when their grandfather, President George H. W. Bush, took office in January 1989 when they were just seven years old. The Massachusetts native served as the 41st president of the United States until January 1993."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

W. Bush</a>, took office in January 1989 when they were just seven years old. The Massachusetts native served as the 41st president of the United States until January 1993. (George H.W. <a href=#>died in November 2018</a> at age 94.)</p><p>His granddaughters’ exploits became front-page news when his eldest son, <a href=#><strong>George W. Bush</strong></a>, ran for president in 2000. When he was sworn in as the 43rd President of the United States in 2001, Jenna and Barbara were already in college — but their lives remained in the limelight.</p><p>Jenna, for her part, also found love thanks to her father’s role as the head of state. She began dating husband <a href=#><strong>Henry Hager</strong></a> in 2004 while he was working on George W.’s reelection campaign in 2004.</p><p>“My worst first date involved the Secret Service, let’s just leave it at that,” Jenna told cohost <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> during a February 2021 episode of <a href=#>Today With Hoda and Jenna</a>. “It was with Henry and his car ran out of gas and went backwards and hit the Secret Service. … I was laughing, but he was horrified.”</p><p>The twosome overcame their disastrous first date and tied the knot in May 2008. The <a href=#>Sisters First: Stories from Our Wild and Wonderful Life coauthor</a> has since welcomed three children — Mila in April 2013, Poppy in August 2015 and Hal in August 2019 — with Henry.</p><p>“Last sunset of the decade that brought us these two beautiful girls and their baby brother,” Jenna <a href=#>wrote via Instagram in December 2019.</a> “How wonderful life is! Hoping 2020 brings you all the joy we get from watching the world through our babes’ eyes. 💫💫⭐️.”</p><p>Jenna later revealed how connected she is with <a href=#>her Today show costars</a> — and fellow moms — and how the TV personalities help one another parent at times.</p><p>“I am so lucky to work with this group of extraordinary moms. We all have kids who are similar ages so it’s been really fun and kind of wild,” she told <a href=#>Hello! magazine</a> in May 2022. “It’s great and I don’t take it lightly. Even this weekend when I was gone, I had one kid my husband had two, and<a href=#><strong> Savannah [Guthrie]</strong></a> picked up my kids and took them to church.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Wonderful World of Blue author added: “I’m so lucky to work with people who I not only adore, but I can lean on them. That’s the true meaning of sisterhood.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Jenna and Henry’s sweetest photos as a family over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a6zZpkm62jnXqprcaeqWagpaivorrDZp%2BepqKuwG6uxKyrZp6RoratxYympqadnqnAbrzHqKuoq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
