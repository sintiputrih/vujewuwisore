NeNe Leakes is still so unimpressed by Andy Cohen’s repeat outfit diss toward her, that she has now vocalized her disdain for the remark via Twitter.
“And what you said was some bulls–t,” the Real Housewives of Atlanta star, 51, tweeted on Monday, December 9. She didn’t elaborate on her point, but the message was seemingly directed at the comment Cohen, 51, made about her days prior."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Was that shady?”</p><p>The Glee alum clapped back at Cohen <a href=#>via Instagram</a> a day after his critical remark aired. Leakes noted that she didn’t understand “the point” behind the Bravo host’s feedback for her fashion choices, but she also regarded his unexpected critique as “pointless” and “messy.”</p><p>“I don’t get it. That was 2 years ago,” she captioned the post, which was accompanied by a clip that featured Cohen’s comment. “I wore this dress ONCE, so I can’t sit in a confessional with it on @bravoandy. How many times have you recycled your suits and ties?”</p><p>Leakes continued, “It’s enough that we #RHOA ladies come for each other and now we have to worry about executives coming for us! No, I mean coming for me! It’s not cool. Wasn’t you interviewing those girls? What you mad about?”</p><p>The Never Make the Same Mistake Twice author claimed that Bravo executives “stay coming” for her, and added that she does not “appreciate this at all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Leakes is not alone in wearing clothes twice. In a separate <a href=#>Instagram update</a>, the reality TV star pointed out across several images that many female stars have recycled their outfits including <a href=#><strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a>, <strong>Kiera Knightley</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>. Leakes noted in the post’s caption that she was “not sure why women who are public figures can’t repeat an outfit.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>Tiffany Haddish</a></strong> has <a href=#>repeatedly worn her iconic Alexander McQueen gown</a>, which she debuted at the premiere of Girls Trip in July 2017. She later took the stage of 90th Academy Awards in February 2018 with <a href=#><strong>Maya Rudolph</strong></a>, glammed up in the designer dress.</p><p>While sporting the look once more during her <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> monologue in November 2017, Haddish <a href=#>explained why she is not ashamed</a> to keep wearing the designer outfit. “I don’t give a dang about no taboo. I spent a lot of money on this dress! This dress cost way more than my mortgage,” the Nobody’s Fool star, 40, said at the time. “This a Alexander McQueen, OK? It’s a $4,000 dress. I’m going to wear this dress multiple times.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGannZ6aeq2xwKScrGWTlrmtv4yapZ2xXZi8qbHNrGSrnaOlvK%2B%2FxGarqGWUp7K0v4ydoKyrXZfCrbjSZqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
