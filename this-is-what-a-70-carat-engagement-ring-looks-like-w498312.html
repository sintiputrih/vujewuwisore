Model Ksenia Tsaritsina became engaged in May with a 70-carat asscher cut diamond ring, valued at $8 million. So it should come as no surprise that her August 12 wedding to Russian oligarch Aleksey Shapovalov was straight out of a fairytale. The extravagant event took place at at Barvikha Luxury Village Hotel in Moscow, where rooms start at $644 a night."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And the 27-year-old wore two elaborate gowns: an intricately beaded design for the ceremony and for the party, a sparkly dress with lace panels.</p><p>Their guests, who were required to wear black, white or red, noshed on a eight-tear cake that was designed to look like it was floating in the air. Other special touches included glittering chandeliers, thousands of white flowers, and performances by Russian singer Polina Gagarin and rock band Leningrad, the <a href=#><i>Business Insider</i></a> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Tsaritsina showed off her 70 carat engagement ring on Instagram back in April. “My husband is never too stingy to buy my presents,” she wrote in Russian, according to the the <i>Daily Mail</i>. “Now he made a decision that a 30-carat ring is not enough for me.” Not everyone was impressed. One person commented: “I think it is too large and her finger would get tired to wear it all the time.”&nbsp;</p><p>The glamorous couple split their time between Russia and Dubai. They have been together for five years and share two children.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m1qr%2BMoqpmr5iWwW6tjHBnZpuRp661ecSnnpqflaKyr8CMq6Cnn12hvLC30majoqOVYsR1hZdsaGtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
