She grew up alongside her older siblings, Justin and Courtney.&nbsp;</p><p>Ashley met Nick after she moved to Kansas City to begin her teaching career. At the time, Nick was the offensive quality control coach for the Kansas City Chiefs. Courtney reportedly persuaded Brett to go out with Nick, sparking a romance that still burns strong.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick and Brett wed on 22nd June 2013 in Kansas City. The couple welcomed their first son, Jacob, in 2015; Taylor, their daughter, arrived in 2017; Miles, the last born, was born in 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brett-supported-eagles-fans-when-they-booed-nick></span>Brett supported Eagles fans when they booed Nick<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During Nick’s first year, the Eagles endured an underwhelming start to the season. In the second preseason match, the Eagles lost 35-0 to the Patriots. Understandably, the pessimistic Eagles fans jeered and booed their new coach.&nbsp;</p><p>NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth said on&nbsp;Sunday Night Football&nbsp;that Brett sided with the Eagles fans rather than her husband. Collinsworth explained:</p><p>“And he [Nick] went home, and he was like ‘can you believe they were booing us – 28-0 and it’s preseason?’ His wife [Brett] was like, ‘what did you give them to cheer about?’ It didn’t take her long to fit right in.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynoJyjXai2s7XAp6Wiq12stqexjJqjpWWRl7y2wIybqZ6spGKutLTLnrBmm5Gjwbixy6Vm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
