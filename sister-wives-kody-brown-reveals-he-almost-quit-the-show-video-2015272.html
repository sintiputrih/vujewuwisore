Sister Wives star Kody Brown has lived his life on TV since 2010, but as he reveals in this exclusive clip from the new tell-all special airing Sunday, March 1, he very nearly reached his breaking point with the TLC show earlier this season.
Brown — who has four wives and 17 children — says he thought about quitting after an on-air argument with his third wife, Christine, and a storm of negative reactions to some comments he’d made about her “PMS-ing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I was dead serious. I had had enough.”</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async width=467 height=266 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kody Brown Sister Wives" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Given his polygamist lifestyle, Brown is no stranger to criticism — many people simply don’t understand his family dynamic. But the vitriol got worse in January, after he said PMS made his wives “insane” and then told Christine she wasn’t “being responsible with how [she was] behaving.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reflecting on the incident on the tell-all special, Brown admits he may not have been responsible with his behavior, either.</p><p>“I’m sorry that I didn’t understand it well enough. And I’m sorry that it becomes a very offensive and polarizing thing,” he says in the above clip. “I actually apologized to Christine about this whole experience, but the PMS subject — in spite of being married for so many years — was a new problem to me. And so, when it became a real thing to me, it was a place where I was very insensitive about it.”</p><p>The Sister Wives season five finale airs Sunday, March 1, at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT, followed immediately by Sister Wives Tell All at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWbpLG6ecGrprCmXaeyt7HApapmoJVirq25zqyrZqmlnsFuwMeeZKygn6x6t7XDnqZmamBmgnODkWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
