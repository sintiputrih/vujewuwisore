Jamie, who played Laurie Strode in <strong>John Carpenter’s</strong>&nbsp;original Halloween in 1978, attended the premiere of Halloween Ends&nbsp;on Oct. 11. Jamie’s daughters, <strong>Ruby Guest </strong>and <strong>Annie Guest</strong>, joined her at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, helping to celebrate the (presumably) final chapter of Laurie’s longtime battle with silent masked killer <strong>Michael Myers.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-Kids-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“My family. Proudest mother. Loving support,” Jamie Lee, captioned an<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram photo</a> of her with Annie, 35, and Ruby, 26, on the red carpet. Annie wore a strapless black dress with silver roses on each side of the bodice. Ruby donned a silver dress and a black jacket to help her stay warm in the October weather.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-Kids-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>When Jamie Lee isn’t battling her onscreen demons, she’s being a proud mom. She and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christopher Guest </strong></a>– the screenwriter and actor behind such films as This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best In Show, and A Mighty Wind – adopted their children in the late 1980s and early ’90s. When speaking at the 2019 ICG Publicists Awards in Los Angeles, Jamie Lee, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter</a> of Psycho star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Janet Leigh </strong></a>and actor <strong>Tony Curtis, </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cited her mother’s four-decade marriage</a> to <strong>Robert Brandt </strong>as an example of the importance of family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“My mother and stepfather were married for 43 years, so I had a very good role model for that,” she has said. “I’m still married to my first husband, and we proudly have two beautiful children.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Jamie’s children remain largely out of the spotlight, below is everything we have been able to gather about the proud mom’s two daughters.</p><h2>Ruby Guest</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ruby was born in March 1996, making her Jamie’s youngest daughter. In a July 2021 interview with AARP, Jamie <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared that her youngest is transgender</a>, revealing with her daughter’s permission that she and Christopher “have watched in wonder and pride as our son became our daughter Ruby.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Ruby, a computer gaming editor, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tied the knot in 2022</a> with her mom as an officiant at the wedding. It was a cosplay-themed ceremony, and afterward, Jamie playfully suggested that her Halloween&nbsp;nemesis even paid a visit. “The ONLY thing left over at the end of this entire BEAUTIFUL wedding, after everything was taken away was this f-ing BUTCHER KNIFE they cut the tiramisu wedding cake with!” Curtis captioned an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram gallery</a>.” WIFE IS SWEET!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-Ruby-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>In October 2021, Jamie and Ruby spoke with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> about Ruby coming into her truth as a trans woman. “It was scary — just the sheer fact of telling them something about me they didn’t know,” Ruby said. “It was intimidating — but I wasn’t worried. They had been so accepting of me my entire life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After failing to vocalize that she was trans, she texted her mother the news. “I called her immediately,” said Jamie Lee. “Needless to say, there were some tears involved.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Like her older sister, Ruby was adopted by Jamie Lee and Christopher when she was an infant. Where the couple “sought out” Annie, a “set of circumstances occurred, all of which were celestial” resulted in Curtis and Guest adopting Ruby, according to Jamie Lee’s 1997 interview in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pact’s Point Of View newsletter</a>. “It was serendipitous and involved a friend of mine who died last year. Five or six events came together, all of which resulted in our family growing within four days.” Jamie said she was able to witness Ruby’s birth, participate in the ceremony, cut her umbilical cord and be the first person to hold her. I thought, I have very thoroughly lived a life. The birth of my [daughter] changed me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Ruby’s journey has helped her mother understand that gender isn’t fixed, which coincides with Jamie Lee’s practice of letting go of things that don’t suit her life anymore. “I am somebody who sheds every day,” the True Lies actress said earlier in the AARP Magazine feature. “Let’s get rid of that, I don’t need that. It’s all about old ideas that don’t work anymore.” She says that her life is a “constant metamorphosis.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“It’s speaking a new language,” Jamie Lee told PEOPLE in 2021. “It’s learning new terminology and words. I am new at it. I am not someone who is pretending to know much about it. And I’m going to blow it, I’m going to make mistakes. I would like to try to avoid making big mistakes. …You still mess up, I’ve messed up today twice. We’re human. But if one person reads this, sees a picture of Ruby and me, and says, ‘I feel free to say this is who I am,’ then it’s worth it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In 2017, Jamie — who has long been vocal about her support for the LGBTQ+ community — expressed her support for the trans community by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>re-tweeting a Huffington Post article</a> entitled, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Dear Trans Kids: (From A Trans Teacher).”</a> The open letter told trans kids, in part: “You are so loved . . . I love your beautiful wisdom, your defiance, your joy. I love the way you make your own language and choreograph your own dance through the world. I love the way you imagine yourself into being. I love your wonder. And I can’t wait to see all that you do in the world.”</p><h2>Annie Guest</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Annie was born in December 1986, making her Jamie’s oldest daughter. An alum of Kenyon College with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance, she is a professional dancer and dance instructor, working at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MNR Dance Factory</a> in Los Angeles. She got married in 2019 to her partner <strong>Jason Wolf</strong>. Jamie <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>documented her daughter’s wedding day</a> on Instagram, revealing Annie’s exquisite <strong>Zac Posen</strong> gown. “A spectacular celebration yesterday at our home for the marriage between our daughter Annie and Jason Wolf,” she captioned the post. “A loving, familial blending with laughs and tears and truth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-kids-annie-ruby-ss-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>The eldest child of Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest came into their lives shortly after she was born. “We were married in 1984 and adopted Annie in 1986 in an open adoption,” Jamie Lee told Pact’s Point Of View. “It probably was different for us than for most others. There’s something that happens to other people when you become very, very famous. It’s a look in their eyes — they’re afraid to look straight at you; they treat you like royalty; they’re very self-conscious. But when we met Annie’s birth mother and she said, ‘Hi, I’m happy to meet you,’ it was like, boom, it was OK. I knew we could adopt.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>As to why Curtis and Guest went the adoption route, Jamie Lee revealed it was due to infertility. “Adoption was the only way for us to have a family. People who adopt who are fertile have a more difficult decision than when you have no other option. It becomes the viable option for you. If you want to be a family, that’s how you’re going to be it. I don’t think you feel like a family until the child is born.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>It’s quite rare for the actress to share photos of Annie or Ruby on her Instagram. But before sharing pictures from her at-home wedding, Jamie showed off her dancer daughter’s flair for fashion, sharing a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of Annie in a stylish jumpsuit</a> during a set visit on her TV series Scream Queens. “My beautiful and talented daughter, Annie, came to visit me in NOLA,” Jamie captioned the regal photo. While the star and her children maintain a low-key family presence in the public eye, it’s clear that the Guest clan is a tight-knit group.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mapKKdXaGypnnCrqmtoaNiuKqw0mZrbmthZ4Jyew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
