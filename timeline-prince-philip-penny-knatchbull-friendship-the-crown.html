While the show seems to hint at rumors of an affair between the two, the reality may not be as messy as it's portrayed to be.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">First things first: who exactly is Penny, and what's her connection to the royal family?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born Penelope Meredith Mary Eastwood, Penny is the daughter of Reginald Eastwood, who founded restaurant chain Angus Steakhouse, and Marian Hood. Her involvement with the royal family began when she married Norton Knatchbull, the Earl Mountbatten of Burma, thus making her the Countess Mountbatten of Burma. Norton also happens to be the second cousin of King Charles, who served as the best man at their wedding, and the godson of Prince Philip.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Together, Penny and Norton had three children: Nicholas, Alexandra, and Leonora. The Crown depicts the aftermath of the death of their youngest daughter, Leonora, who passed away at five years old after a battle with kidney cancer. In the midst of her grief, Philip (played by Jonathan Pryce) reached out to Penny (Natascha McElhone) and the two struck up a close friendship that has endured over the years.</p><img alt="jonathan pryce and natascha mcelhone as prince philip and penny knatchbull" title="jonathan pryce and natascha mcelhone as prince philip and penny knatchbull" width=2304 height=1152 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/thecrown-s05-image-25-new-1668023185.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Jonathan Pryce and Natascha McElhone as Prince Philip and Penny Knatchbull.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the Netflix series suggests romantic undertones to Philip and Penny's relationship (though, ultimately, the show itself allows the audience to interpret their dynamic as they see fit), there isn't much real-life evidence to support rumors of an affair between the two. In fact, Philip wasn't the only royal that Penny was close to. She has close and public bonds with many members of the family—not least of all her friendship with Queen Elizabeth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, we break down the timeline of Philip and Penny's friendship, from the duo bonding over carriage driving to Penny being one of 30 guests at Philip's funeral.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">1970s: She meets Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip for the first time.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Penny's first encounter with the queen and Philip occurred during her engagement to Norton.
