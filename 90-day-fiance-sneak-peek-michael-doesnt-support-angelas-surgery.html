He’s gonna be 33, I’m gonna be 55. My skin’s going to change, and I’m going to start to look older than I am. And Michael is still going to be as young as he looked the day I married him. So if I’m not young, I need to at least look the damn part and it starts with my weight.“</p><p class=xmsonormal>The Nigeria native, however, tells her,&nbsp;“You know I like big things.

I feel she want to risk it all. You know, she just wants a quick result, so she had to go for the bigger surgeries.”</p><p class=xmsonormal>When Angela <a href=#>spoke with&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i> exclusively last month</a>, she promised that the surgery was for health reasons in addition to her desire to look young.
