It was re-upped in 2016 with a five-year extension worth $46 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Like lots of celebrities who suddenly come into a lot of money, Kelce went through a lot of the cash from his first contract. <a href=#>According to Sportscasting</a>, in an interview with Shannon Sharpe, Kelce shared that he "should have been on the 30 for 30 Broke the way I was spending my money." Purchases included the limited edition self-lacing Nike MAGS modeled after Marty McFly's sneakers from Back To The Future II&nbsp;and a Rolex watch.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, he seems to have learned some budgeting techniques. In addition to his contract, worth millions of dollars, Kelce has some lucrative endorsement deals. <a href=#>The Street notes</a> that he starred in a McDonald's commercial and has launched his own nutritional brand, Hilo Nutrition, and lifestyle brand, TruKolors. He even had his very own dating show on E! in 2016, titled&nbsp;Catching Kelce, on which women competed to date him. It wasn't a hit, but it presumably brought in at least some money, adding to Kelce's net worth, which is estimated at an impressive $20 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkWxoamxfqb%2BiwsisZKSdnJiybrXSZq6oqqSdeqJ5y6irZqWfp7Juuc6nnLJlpJ2ur3nYqKxmrJieu6x7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
