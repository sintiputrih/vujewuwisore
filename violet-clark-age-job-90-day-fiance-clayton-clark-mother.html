Clayton’s apparent unwillingness to comprehend Anali’s need for her own space, after all, did not appear to bode well for their marriage. Anali was unsatisfied that she could have to share a home with her mother-in-law and that she had to struggle for a spot in her own husband’s family.</p><p>Anali couldn’t help but worry how she could make her relationship work given that she was far from the comfort of her own home and that the language barrier was making things even more difficult. The two ladies in Clayton’s life also appeared to be causing him conflict. He also complained that Anali’s father did not even know that he existed, and that she had not yet told him why she was traveling to the United States.</p><h3><strong>What Happened To Violet Clark Husband?</strong></h3><p>Violet Clark was married to her husband James Dean Clark.
