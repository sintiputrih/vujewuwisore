Fif brought this up, once again, when Buck's girlfriend was arrested. “Better stop playing with them boys, on Ig Buck she want YOUR pass word. LOL,&#34; Fif captioned a post.
It didn't take long for Buck to fire right back. Fif has continued to face allegations of cooperating with federal authorities which have haunted him over the years-- as recent as January, French Montana exposed 50 Cent's alleged informant paperwork."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Somebody tell this bitch ass nigga 50cent Finish Dat Bowl of #FruitSteroids,” he wrote. “and wrap ya Monthly Police Report Up …. C.I #ConfidentialInformant Face Ass,"&nbsp;Buck wrote before reminding Fif that they do have history together.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"CURTIS…it’s me BUCK….don’t ever forget I Know U….and I Ain’t Got Started Yet," he added.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">So far, no word from 50 Cent but we'll keep you posted.
