Born to Hollywood actors, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, Lucy DeVito began attracting the attention of the public right from when she was young.</p><p>Her parents tried their best to protect Lucy and her sibling from this. Yes, she is not their only child but the first of the three kids they have. Although she was born in New York, it was in California and New Jersey that she spent most of her early life. It is said that she was raised in a not-too-religious Catholic family, the faith of her father.</p><p>On the other hand, her mother is Jewish. So Lucy is half-Jewish and familiar with the holidays peculiar to the religion. She has celebrated both Passover and Hanukkah at some point in life.</p><p>Most reports have established that Lucy DeVito is of Italian descent; this is true. Although her father Danny DeVito was born in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and raised in Asbury Park, also in New Jersey, his family originally hails from San Fele, Basilicata, and Calabria, which are both located in Southern Italy.</p><p>From her mother’s side of the family, Lucy has Polish heritage with some measure of Russian Jewish roots. Her maternal grandfather Philip Perlman was an American businessman and actor who immigrated to the United States from Poland.</p><h3><strong>Lucy DeVito is College Educated</strong></h3><p>Details of the schools she attended growing up are yet to be ascertained but we can confirm that Lucy DeVito is college-educated. After she graduated from high school, she decided to further her education at Brown University, a private Ivy League university located in Providence, Rhode Island.</p><p>She graduated from the institution with a degree in theater; this was in 2007. Before this, she had already commenced her career journey as a professional actress. From what we gathered, she began performing on stage when she was young and got to play various roles in multiple theatre productions. Her love for performing arts deepened as she got older and it was not a surprise for the people around her, considering who her parents are.</p><h2><strong>Lucy DeVito Was Born Into an Entertainment Family – Meet Her Parents and Siblings</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Lucy-DeVito.jpg><p>Again, the actress’ first claim to fame was through her parents. Long before she started making a name for herself in the entertainment industry, she was known as the daughter of a Hollywood couple, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman. She is the oldest of their three kids (two daughters and a son) and also the most popular. Lucy has a good relationship with both of her parents, as much as she has a great bond with her siblings.</p><h3 id=firstHeading class="firstHeading mw-first-heading"><strong>Danny DeVito (Father)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Daniel Michael DeVito Jr.</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>November 17, 1944</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>79 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Actor, Film Director, Producer, and Screenwriter</li></ul><p>Lucy DeVito’s father Danny DeVito has been active in the movie industry since 1969.

Some of her recent works include Poms, Funny Face, Marvelous and the Black Hole, Harley Quinn, and Star Wars: The Bad Batch.</p><h3><strong>Gracie DeVito (Sister)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Grace Fan DeVito</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>March 25, 1985</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>38 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Actress and Producer</li></ul><p>Gracie is the second child of the family and like her older sister, she has a career in the movie industry; although it doesn’t seem to be as serious as Lucy DeVito’s. The middle child of the family, you will find Gracie in Amboy, a 2015 sci-fi fantasy mystery film directed by Frances Scholz. She also played an Alien Actress in Jeff & Some Aliens, a sci-fi comedy animation series created by Sean Donnelly and Alessandro Minoli.</p><p>Her works as a producer include a short comedy-drama titled Bloom and the 2006 comedy film directed by Benji Samit, My Girlfriend’s Abroad. Gracie got married to a fellow named Andy in 2019.</p><h3><strong>Jake DeVito (Brother)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Jacob Daniel DeVito</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>October 10, 1987</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>36 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Actor and Producer</li></ul><p>Like other members of his family, Jake also works in the movie industry as an actor and producer. As an actor, he debuted in 2005 when he played David Lekkas in Pieces of a Dream. Apart from the drama film directed by Skee Skinner, you will also find him in 2015’s Amboy. He has worked in the camera and electrical department of productions like Palpitations, Nest of Vipers, and Flok.</p><p>Nonetheless, most of the work he has done in the industry is as a producer. He first produced The Better Angels, Quicksand, and Fair Chase in 2014. These were followed by 2016’s Curmudgeons and 2020’s Wererock. St. Sebastian and Little Demon are the works he has in the pipeline as a producer as of January 2022.</p><h3><strong>Her Parents Separated In March 2017 But Are Still Legally Married</strong></h3><p>Lucy DeVito once described her family as a close-knit one, this has not changed even though her parents have been separated since March 2017. The couple reportedly met in 1971 when Lucy’s mother went to see a stage performance wherein Danny performed alongside one of her friends. They were introduced to each other and it marked the beginning of their love story.</p><p>Danny and Rhea started dating and cohabited for eleven years before they got married; this was on the 28th of January 1982. They lived and worked together while raising their three kids until October 2012 when it emerged that they had separated. This was after four decades of living together and 30 years of marriage. They reconciled in March 2017 only to separate again in March 2017.</p><p>Details of the issues that led to their separation are quite sketchy but it is known that they parted amicably and have remained on good terms. The estranged couple are yet to file for divorce and according to Rhea, they have no intention of doing so. She said <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>they became good friends after their separation</a> compared to the latter years of their marriage.</p><h3><strong>How Successful an Actress Is Lucy Compared to Her Parents?</strong></h3><p>Since Lucy DeVito debuted as a professional actress, she has been seen in dozens of movies and TV shows. She has also spread her wings in the industry to become a producer. She first produced the 2016 short film directed by her father, Curmudgeons, and is currently executing the production of Little Demon, a TV movie. Lucy has accomplished a lot in her career but she has a long way to go if she must equal either of her parents’ achievements in the industry.</p><p>Her mother Rhea Perlman has thus far been seen in at least 112 productions. She has received some of the most coveted awards in the business, including 10 nominations for Primetime Emmy, out of which she won four; multiple Golden Globes nominations, and much more.</p><p>The same goes for her father who has no fewer than 142 works in his filmography. The nominations Danny has received are simply too many to count. A Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series are among the multiple gongs he has received.</p><h2><strong>Lucy DeVito’s Height Is 4 Feet 11 Inches (150 cm) But She Doesn’t Feel Insecure About Her Height</strong></h2><p>The actress once proudly stated that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>she came “from a long line of shorties”</a>. Even though she only stands at 4 feet 11 inches (150 cm), it doesn’t make her feel less of herself nor has it affected her career in any negative way, at least to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>According to various reports, the average height for Hollywood actresses is 5 feet 5 inches. This means that most of the actresses in the American film industry are significantly taller than Lucy DeVito.</p><p>That is also the case when one compares her height to women working in other industries in the country. It is said that the average height for women in the United States is 5 feet 4 inches.</p><h3><strong>How Tall Is She Compared to Members of Her Family?</strong></h3><p>While Lucy isn’t someone you would describe as a tall woman on any day, she is not the least tall in her family. That title goes to her father Danny DeVito. The actor known for his short status has Fairbank’s disease, otherwise known as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. From what we gathered, it is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth.</p><ul><li>Lucy DeVito’s Height – 4 feet 11 inches (150 cm)</li><li>Danny DeVito’s Height – 4 feet 9¾ inches (147 cm)</li><li>Rhea Perlman’s Height – 5 feet (152 cm)</li><li>Gracie DeVito’s Height – 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm)</li><li>Jake DeVito’s Height – 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm)</li></ul><h2><strong>Is Lucy Devito Married?</strong></h2><p>Lucy DeVito, to the best of our knowledge, has never been married. All through the years she has spent in the limelight, she has never made headlines because of her love life. She obviously prefers keeping the attention she gets on her career as she has relentlessly kept her romantic relationships away from the public.</p><p>Because of this, several platforms have reported that she is single. This might be true but it is perhaps better to just admit that nothing is known about her love life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC41JywZpyVq7a1u4yhnKKfmKl6orPEZqeaqpWjwbR50qKZpaGenMBussCmoKWxXZe2sLPRmqehsV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
