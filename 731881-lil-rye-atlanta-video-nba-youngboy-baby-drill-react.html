After the Alabama rapper claimed a group jumped him at a mall over his oversized pendant, NBA YoungBoy and Baby Drill both chimed in on the incident. "B-tch got stripped out of his clothes like a h-e. Don't entertain him no more," YB said in the comments of Rye's video. Meanwhile, Drill reposted the video with laughing emojis before adding "N-ggas coming to the city thinking sh-t sweet. Tell em tap in" in a separate post.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, YoungBoy and Rye have been beefing for about a month now after YB called Rye a rookie. Rye then said he was going to "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">take a trip to Utah</a>" which was widely taken as a shot at YB. In response, YB dropped a freestyle called "Fan of Me" last week, which was widely seen as a response to Rye. However, Rye is yet to respond to YB and Drill dunking on him for the incident in Atlanta.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-suge-knight-praises-yb>Suge Knight Praises YB</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, YB is widely seen as a well-loved figure in the rap scene. He recently received high praise from Suge Knight. "But you still got people still in the game doing well. And they deserve their cigars. you know? It's just like… NBA YoungBoy. Man, I like that lil' young motherf-cker. He deserves his cigar. He talk sh-t, he about that life. You know, he march to his own motherf-cking beat, you know?" Suge said in a recent podcast episode.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite this, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">not everybody loves YB</a>. At the start of last month, YB appeared to respond to getting dissed by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> on For All The Dogs. "Try again bi-tch a-- n-gga. And stop sucking that boy d-ck he know I'm gone cutthroat the fuck out. Record my d-ck n-gga, you a h-e," YB wrote on Instagram in the hours after Drake dropped "8AM in Charlotte".</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-baby-drill-reacts>Baby Drill Reacts</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Are you siding with Rye or YB & Drill on this one?</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-rye-details-jumping>Lil Rye Details Jumping</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, follow all the latest music news here at HotNewHipHop.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
