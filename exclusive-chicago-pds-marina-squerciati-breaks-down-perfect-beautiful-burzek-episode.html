The team then worked together to track down the shooter and uncover the true motive behind the attack, with Ruzek – who is back on the team after a nine-month recovery – backing his partner the entire time.&nbsp;</p><p id=esH9Kx6IPQ data-wc=40>In the final moments, as they both sat in their pajamas ready for bed, <strong>Kim is honest about what she needs from their relationship, and Adam acknowledges he can give her that, before pulling out an engagement ring and proposing.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b27ae6ff98c-burzek2.jpg><p id=etLOohqsH9 data-wc=52>It's been a long time coming for fans of the pair – known affectionately as Burzek – and for Marina and Patrick J. Flueger, who have played these two characters for over 11 years. But that didn't mean they had any warning that the end of the script would feature a proposal.&nbsp;</p><p id=euidAEXgcO data-wc=33>"Sometimes we get [a warning]: 'You need to go to the gym, you have a sex scene,'" Marina tells <strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong>before joking that, in this case, she was glad there was no warning.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Chicago P.D. cast praised by fans after making incredible gesture amid season 11 delay" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b7c35be670e7-tracy-john-chicago-pd.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Chicago P.D. cast praised by fans after making incredible gesture amid season 11 delay" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Chicago P.D. cast praised by fans after making incredible gesture amid season 11 delay</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=efVzUZmmSrr data-wc=40>"I read the script and if Scott Gold, who wrote this magnificent script, had told me, 'You're just in pajamas and it's really casual,' I would have said: 'Oh Burgess deserves better,' but it is exactly what they both need.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8m3FXaqEl data-wc=63>"They've been through so much Sturm und Drang that <strong>this is perfect and beautiful and they both say exactly what they mean.

"If I knew I was hitting home runs all the time, maybe I'd become complacent but I agonize all the time; Paddy and I worry, 'Do we do this? Or do we do this?' We still care and we still love it."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8e7119835f3-nup20071600619.jpg><p id=eq_ExF2mNa data-wc=67>When asked if we will see the pair telling their close friends and family, Marina sidestepped by acknowledging the show isn't all about Kim, with episode four "a great Torres episode and Benjamin [Levy Aguilar] hit it out of the park, which is great, and then we're turning to Voight and his rage is coming back, and I think fans will be excited to see old Voight".</p><p id=edVb3tikXD data-wc=28><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>With Tracy Spiridakos, who plays Hailey Upton, leaving at the end of the season,</a> Marina added that this is the opportunity to explore "Voight and Burgess' special relationship".&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Chicago PD boss teases Hailey and Jay's future after devastating episode" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/98f90c0c13ed-nup20320200639.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Chicago PD boss teases Hailey and Jay's future after devastating episode" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Chicago PD boss teases Hailey and Jay's future after devastating episode</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Tracy&nbsp;Spiridakos&nbsp;will appear in all 13 episodes of Chicago PD season 11" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ffbcef98cbb9-tracy-spiridakos.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Tracy&nbsp;Spiridakos&nbsp;will appear in all 13 episodes of Chicago PD season 11" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Tracy&nbsp;Spiridakos&nbsp;will appear in all 13 episodes of Chicago PD season 11</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e7IBd4QLA4 data-wc=66>"I don't want her to be the moral center like Jay Halstead was – I don't think that's her position – but I do think that she can offer something to Voight and I'd like to see what that is.
