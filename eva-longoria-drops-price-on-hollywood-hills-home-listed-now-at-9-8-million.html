Yep, two houses for the price of one, depending on how you calculate prices: One a a four bedroom, four bathroom country-style home, and the other a French villa with three beds and three baths. There's also room on the almost three acre property for "two standalone studios and a quaint stone cottage."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-273262 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/47161080_10155651384531809_2502562484284555264_n.jpg alt width=900 height=505 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-273262 class=wp-caption-text>TheAgencyRE</p><p>Interestingly, it's the three-bed, three-bath house that's considered the primary residence according to the real estate agency's official YouTube listing for the house. Both of the homes on this property boast "panoramic views" of the surrounding valley, along with unique touches like a&nbsp;storybook footbridge," and if you plan on having company, there are plenty of spots for your guests to enjoy the scenery:</p><p><strong>"Surrounded by an abundance of mature shade trees and flanked by a series of meandering, stone-paved walking paths, the property showcases an array of outdoor entertaining terraces."</strong></p><p>It just goes to show that no matter how perfect your home is, it can still be a pain in the neck to sell. And about that official YouTube listing, if you'd like to take a brief look at this home/homes that's been the private sanctuary for both Tom Cruise and Eva Longoria, you can do so below.
