Miles was eventually signed to various studio contracts. “I was dropped by the best studios in town,” she once said.</p><p>Miles made her film debut in The Rose Bowl Story (1952), a romantic comedy in which she played a Tournament of Roses queen. Miles was cast as Tarzan’s love interest in the 1955 film Tarzan’s Hidden Jungle, alongside her future husband Gordon Scott, while under contract to Warner Bros.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The following year, she was cast by director John Ford as Jeffrey Hunter’s love interest in the John Wayne Western The Searchers (1956), and she appeared in Jacques Tourneur’s Wichita and Van Johnson’s 23 Paces to Baker Street.</p><p>Miles also appeared in the 1956 film The Wrong Man as Rose Balestrero, the fragile wife of Manny Balestrero, a musician falsely accused of a crime played by Henry Fonda. Alfred Hitchcock directed the film, which is one of only a few Hitchcock films based on true events.</p><p>Miles was widely publicized as Hitchcock’s potential successor to Grace Kelly after signing a five-year personal contract with him in 1957. Hitchcock had directed Miles in the role of Ralph Meeker’s emotionally troubled new bride in “Revenge,” the pilot episode of his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents, two years before.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Vertigo (1958), which Hitchcock intended to be a showcase for his new star, was plagued by production delays. Miles’ subsequent pregnancy cost her the lead role, which eventually went to Kim Novak, with whom Hitchcock allegedly clashed, though Ms. Novak has stated in interviews that she had no problems working with Hitchcock on the film.</p><p>Vertigo (which also starred James Stewart) was a commercial and critical failure at the time, with Hitchcock claiming that Novak was miscast. Despite Hitchcock’s disappointment with Vertigo, he continued to work with Miles, eventually casting her in what is arguably her most famous role, that of Lila Crane in Psycho.</p><p>In the film, she played Marion Crane’s (Janet Leigh) determined sister, who teams up with Marion’s boyfriend and a private investigator to find her. Miles later appeared in two episodes of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Alfred Hitchcock Hour (in 1962 and 1965).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Miles reteamed with director John Ford for the 1962 film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. She is pursued by both Wayne and James Stewart, two very different men competing for her hand in marriage, as she stars alongside her former co-star from The Searchers, John Wayne.</p><p>Miles appeared in many popular television shows throughout her career, including Gunsmoke, Wagon Train, Laramie, The Twilight Zone, and the western series Riverboat, starring Darren McGavin and Burt Reynolds.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>She also appeared as a guest star in episodes of The Outer Limits, Burke’s Law, The Eleventh Hour, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and Ironside, as well as co-starring in the first episode of ABC’s The Fugitive (titled “Fear in a Desert City”).</p><p>Miles appeared in three episodes of the CBS series My Three Sons in 1965. The same year, she co-starred with lead actors Robert Culp and Bill Cosby in “Affair in T’Sien Cha,” the pilot episode of the TV series I Spy (though the pilot was not actually broadcast until midway through the series’ first season).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Other notable films in which Miles appeared included Walt Disney’s Follow Me, Boys! (1966), in which he co-starred with Fred MacMurray, and Hellfighters (1968), in which he reunited with John Wayne.&nbsp; Miles had also appeared in scenes with Wayne in the 1968 film The Green Berets, playing Wayne’s character’s wife. Her scenes were cut due to Warner Bros. wanting more action in the film.</p><p>Throughout the 1970s, Miles appeared in a number of TV films and TV series, including the pilot for the TV series Cannon (which aired in March 1971) as the wife of a deceased war comrade of private investigator Frank Cannon, played by William Conrad.</p><p>During the series’ run, she appeared in two more episodes in various roles. In 1973, she co-starred with Peter Falk in “Lovely But Lethal,” an episode of NBC’s Columbo in which she played a cosmetics queen who commits murder.</p><p>She also appeared as a guest star in episodes of Hawaii Five-O, The Streets of San Francisco, and Fantasy Island, among other shows. In 1983, more than 20 years after Psycho, Miles reprised her role as Lila Crane in Psycho II, alongside Anthony Perkins. Miles and Perkins were the only original film stars who returned for this sequel.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-918 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Throughout the 1980s, Miles appeared in a number of TV and film productions, including appearances in the films The Initiation (1984) and Into the Night (1985), as well as guest appearances on episodes of the TV shows The Love Boat (1982 and 1984) and Hotel (1985). (1984 and 1987).</p><p>She also appeared in three episodes of Murder, She Wrote, co-starring Angela Lansbury, that aired in 1985, 1990, and 1991. Her final television appearance was in the 1991 episode “Thursday’s Child.” Miles only appeared in one more film, Separate Lives (1995), alongside James Belushi, before retiring from the industry.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2 id=h-vera-miles-movies-and-tv-shows>Vera Miles Movies and Tv Shows</h2><h3 id=h-movies>Movies</h3><ul><li>1950 When Willie
