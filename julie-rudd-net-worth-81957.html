Then he'd come off and ask me for observations. And he was totally serious about it. One night I asked him about all the tape marks all over the floor when he sang. And he asked the lighting guy to bring up the lights one by one and I saw how they 'hit the marks'. Frank just walked over to me and explained how lighting will enhance musical moments".</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1968</span><p>Budd began her singing career at the age of 12, taking the stage for amateur night at the Tamarack resort camp in the Catskills.
