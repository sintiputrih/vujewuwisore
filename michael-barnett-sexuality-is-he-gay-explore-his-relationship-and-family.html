Since his divorce from his ex-wife, the former real estate agent has not remarried or dated anyone.</strong></p><p>Michael Barnett was a former real estate agent and businessman. The real estate agent and his ex-wife, Kristine Barnett, were accused of abandoning their adopted daughter, Natalia Grace, whom they described as an adult acting like a child.</p><p>The case sparked intense debate and speculation about the Barnetts’ motivations, as well as Natalia’s true age and identity. While the Barnetts’ charges were dropped in 2020 due to the statute of limitations, many questions remain about their family drama.</p><h2><span id=Is_Michael_Barnett_Gay_Sexuality_Explored>Is Michael Barnett Gay? Sexuality Explored</span></h2><p>The short answer is that Michael Barnett is not gay. He has never officially identified as homosexual or bisexual, and he has never been romantically involved with a man. He has only dated women before, including his ex-wife Kristine, whom he married in 2004 and divorced in 2014.</p><p>However, there have been speculations and rumours that Michael Barnett is homosexual or closeted, according to his involvement in the Natalia Grace case. According to some reports, Barnett’s sexuality was one of the reasons he and Kristine decided to adopt Natalia, a Ukrainian orphan with a rare form of dwarfism.</p><p>According to these reports, Michael wanted to adopt a child to hide his homosexuality from his strict community, and he chose Natalia since she was easier to care for than the typical child. These rumours lack credible proof or witnesses, and they appear to be founded on speculation and bias rather than facts.</p><p>Michael has denied being homosexual and having ulterior motives for adopting Natalia. He added that he and Kristine assumed Natalia was a child in need of a loving home, only to discover later that she was an adult with a history of mental illness and violence. Despite the legal and emotional difficulties caused by their relationship, he continues to regard Natalia as his daughter.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Barnett_Family_Partner_and_Children>Michael Barnett Family: Partner and Children</span></h2><p>Michael Barnett and his ex-wife Kristine have three biological children named Jacob, Wesley, and Ethan. Jacob is a child prodigy who was diagnosed with autism at a young age but later demonstrated amazing ability in mathematics and physics. He started college at the age of ten and graduated with a master’s degree at fourteen.</p><p>Wesley and Ethan are smart children who have excelled academically and socially. Michael and Kristine adopted Natalia Grace in 2010, believing she was six years old. However, after seeing several anomalies in her behaviour and appearance, they concluded she was much older than she claimed.</p><p>They took her to numerous doctors and psychiatrists, who determined that she was most likely an adult with a kind of dwarfism known as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. They also discovered that she had previously disguised as a youngster in other foster families, threatened them, and attempted to harm their other children.</p><p>Michael and Kristine legally changed Natalia’s age from eight to twenty-two in 2012, citing medical evidence and court documents. They then moved to Canada with their biological boys, leaving Natalia behind in an Indiana flat with few funds and social services. They explained that they did this out of concern for Natalia’s safety and a wish to provide her the opportunity to live freely as an adult.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Barnett_and_Ex-Wife_Kristine_Case_Updates>Michael Barnett and Ex-Wife Kristine Case Updates</span></h2><p>Michael Barnett and ex-wife Kristine were arrested in 2019 and charged with neglect of a dependent after abandoning Natalia. They pleaded not guilty, accusing Natalia and the adoption agency of defrauding and deceiving them. They also presented evidence that Natalia continued to lie about her age and identity after they left her.</p><p>Michael and Kristine claimed she changed her birth date several times, used multiple identities, applied for social security benefits as a juvenile, went to school, and tried to adopt from another family. The tale drew national and worldwide attention, with many questioning whether Natalia was a child or an adult, a victim or a perpetrator, and if the Barnetts were abusive or protective parents.</p><p>The charges against them were dropped in 2020 after the statute of limitations expired. However, the discussion over their case has not died down, as new videos and interviews have shed more light on the conflicting allegations and evidence.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
