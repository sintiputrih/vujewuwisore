We know that when he was 15 years old he moved from Cuba and went with his family to the United States.</p><p>From his earliest childhood&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;</strong>showed interest in art, particularly in the field of painting but as he grew up there was a moment in his life in which he leaned towards architecture, entering the career in this matter, which he finished but no longer exercised because a new interest arose in his life: the performance.</p><p>It is considered that his artistic career began when&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;</strong>was hired by the Univision and Venevisión networks, back in 2010, at which time the opportunities to participate in the telenovelas that were known with the names of Eva Luna (in which he played the character of Humberto) and Aurora (where we know that he appeared as a guest) come into his life.</p><h2>Trajectory and history of Adrián Di Monte</h2><p>After his appearance in Eva Luna y Aurora, the following year, in 2011,&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;</strong>gave life to the role of the character known as “Papi” in the American telenovela called Mi corazón insiste en Lola Volcán, which we must point out was the adaptation of a Colombian telenovela known as Yo amo a Paquita Gallego.</p><p>Shortly after, in 2013,&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;</strong>participated as part of the cast of the American telenovela known under the title of Rosario, as in charge of interpreting the character of Ignacio (better known as Nacho) Gómez, being in this novel where he met what would be his partner for several years Sandra Itzel. The following year, in 2014,&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;</strong>made his appearance in the productions of melodramas that were known with the names of Cosita linda, with the character of Santiago Rincón, and Voltea pa ́que te enamores, where he gave life to the role of Armando Romero.</p><p>In 2015 and until 2016&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;</strong>would make his appearance in the telenovela ¿Quién es quién?, a production in which he would be given the role of Eugenio Hernández. And already in full 2016 he was in charge of giving life to the character of Abelardo Casares or Abelardo Ochoa in the renowned television series known with the title of Señora Acero: La Coyote, a production that is part of the genre of narco series, with a plot that develops in three seasons in which we will witness personal ambitions, family struggles and rivalries in a world steeped in drug trafficking and money laundering; in this series he shared credits with&nbsp;Litzy,&nbsp;Andrés Palacios,&nbsp;Rebecca Jones,&nbsp;Ana Lucía Domínguez, among others. It would also be in this year when he would appear as a guest artist in the television program called Noches con Platanito.</p><p>The following year, in 2017&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte</strong>&nbsp;made his appearance in the Mexican telenovela that became known as&nbsp;La doble vida de Estela Carrillo, where he gave life to the character of Joe Hernández in a plot that revolves around the themes of emigration and regional Mexican music. We can not ignore that in this same year 2017 would add to his artistic career to be the winner in the television program known under the title of Bailando por un sueño where he would be the big winner surpassing other stars such as&nbsp;Jolette,&nbsp;Ferdinando Valencia,&nbsp;Nora Salinas, among others.</p><p>During the year 2018&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte</strong>&nbsp;was a participant in the program of physical challenges that was known as Challenge 4 elements, where he would turn out to be the winner. And in the same way he would be a judge in the third season of the children’s televised contest&nbsp;Little Giants.</p><p>Later&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;</strong>was part of the cast of the telenovela inscribed within the genre of romantic comedy known as Cita a ciegas, where he gave life to the character of Roberto (better known in the plot as “Bobby”) Silva Esquivel; in a plot that tells the story of Lucia (played by actress Sofia Garza). We can not forget that it was also in 2019 when he made his appearance on the television program&nbsp;Esta historia me suena, in which in a particular way we have knowledge that he was in the episode known with the title “Regálame”, giving life to the character of Guillermo.</p><p>In mid-2021 he arrived for one of the most important projects of the moment for&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte</strong><strong>&nbsp;with “Designing your love”&nbsp;</strong>a telenovela produced by Pedro Ortiz de Pinedo for Televisa which was an adaptation of the Portuguese novel Meu Amor by António Barreira. The telenovela&nbsp;starred&nbsp;Gala Montes,&nbsp;Juan Diego Covarrubias,&nbsp;Ana Belena,&nbsp;Chris Pazcal&nbsp;and&nbsp;Osvaldo de León; It addressed the story of a beautiful girl who loves fashion but she works in a pasteurization factory, however she will meet bad people who will intend to take her money and her father’s company , deceiving her to help her fulfill her dreams, generating from that moment a whole wave of events that were unraveled throughout history.</p><p><strong>In the telenovela “Designing your love” the actor Adrián Di Monte played Leonardo Casanova</strong>, he also shared with a large number of actors and actresses such as&nbsp;Adrián Di Monte,&nbsp;Ale Müller,&nbsp;María Sorté,&nbsp;Sergio Goyri, Norma Herrera, José Elías Moreno,&nbsp;Marco Muñoz,&nbsp;Armando Araiza,&nbsp;Omar Germenos,&nbsp;Mariluz Bermúdez,&nbsp;Martha Julia,&nbsp;Daniela Álvarez&nbsp;, Frances Ondiviela, Alejandra Jurado, Adalberto Parra,&nbsp;Talía Rivera,&nbsp;Ana Lorena Elorduy,&nbsp;Isabella Vázquez, Natalia Madera, Bibelot Mansur, among others. The novel was a success and one of the most important melodramas for televisa of that year.</p><p>One of the most important projects for Televisa in 2022 was the premiere of the remake of “La Madrastra” which had already been done on several occasions and television stations but again was adapted to new technologies and audiovisual proposals.&nbsp;<strong>In the television series “La Madrastra” the actor&nbsp;Adrián Di Monte&nbsp;played Álvaro González.</strong></p><h2>Wife of Adrián Di Monte</h2><h3>Adrián Di Monte and Sandra Itzel</h3><p><strong>Adrián Di Monte</strong>&nbsp;in 2012 was gaining more strength as an actor in Mexico and the United States, he came to do casting for the novel “Rosario” of the Univision network and curiously had to do the test next to Sandra Itzel.</p><p>At first,&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte</strong>&nbsp;confessed that he did not get along with Itzel because both were very pressured to do their roles very well but that with the passage of time, when living together they got along better and better, to the extent that they ended up in a very nice love relationship even when the soap opera in which both participated came to an end.</p><p>Adrián Di Monte prepared in a restaurant the proposal of hand and with the help of a waiter deposited the engagement ring at the bottom of a glass and when they took it to Sandra Itzel was surprised at the beautiful moment but then she knew that it was only a promise ring because with it&nbsp;<strong>Adrián Di Monte</strong>&nbsp;promised that one day he would marry her.&nbsp;“I was so disappointed. I did get excited because it was a promise ring that she was going to get married, but it was not an engagement ring,”&nbsp;Sandra Itzel said in an interview, but even over the years they decided to stay together.</p><h2>Pack de Adrián Di Monte</h2><p>Although in social networks and on the internet people look a lot for Adrián Di Monte’s pack or photos in which you can see with little clothes or in sensual poses, the truth is that at present there is no Adrián Di Monte pack other than those photos that the artist has published in his own networks and that could be considered sexy.</p><h2>How much is Adrián Di Monte’s fortune?</h2><p>This is one of the questions that people ask most about Adrián Di Monte and although they always end up answering it on other pages with a “I don’t know” or “it depends” if there are some estimates that several web portals mention. However, it is not possible to make an exact calculation about the fortune of this great star that is Adrián Di Monte within the middle of the show, even so more than being interested in the fortune of a person the important thing is the talent he has and that I have made him within the great figures of the international entertainment medium.</p><p>No doubt the career of this great star Adrián Di Monte will continue to rise and we will be attentive to everything that happens around him, so we invite you not to take off from our page for the next updates we will have in the&nbsp;<strong>life, trajectory, history and biography of Adrián Di Monte.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOm6Con6KWvanFjKidZpmUp7aiuoydoGaln6PBpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
