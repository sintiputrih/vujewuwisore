The medical examiner earlier noted that Lister died of <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/11/entertainment/thomas-lister-jr-death-trnd/index.html>natural causes.</a></p><p class=Fg>After an autopsy, the medical examiner found out that Lister had fluid in his chest when he died. He also had an enlarged heart, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and poor circulation flow in his legs.</p><p class=Fg>Besides his heart-related condition, Lister also tested positive for COVID-19. Even before the medical examiner confirmed this, the actor's manager, Cindy Cowan, revealed he tested positive for the coronavirus in the early months of 2020.</p><p class=Fg>The <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001474/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">Compton-native actor</a> eventually recovered. But a week prior to his death, Cowan said Lister started to feel sick again and thought his diabetes kicked in. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/tommy-lister-recovered-from-covid-months-before-death/>added</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"He said, 'I feel like I'm getting COVID again.'"</p><p class=Fg>After feeling the symptoms again, he missed work. He was supposed to film a new movie and attend an online conference for a TV festival, but he canceled both saying he was too weak to participate.</p><p class=Fg>Cowan was deeply concerned about him at the time, as he would never miss a scheduled appearance on set or in meetings in the past. He was a dedicated actor and took his career seriously.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>The actor was also an inspiring speaker and a devout church leader.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>Lister's family called him but he did not return their calls. His friend visited him the next day and called the police when no one answered the door. When they finally had access inside the house, they found the actor lifeless.</p><p class=Fg>Cowan said Lister had hoped to receive the COVID-19 vaccine before his death.
