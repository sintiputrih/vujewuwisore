Our vitamin game? Lacking at best. Swallowing multiple giant pills every single day is going to be a “no” from Us, and the chewable kind is often even worse — and bad for our teeth."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Lacking at best. Swallowing multiple giant pills every single day is going to be a “no” from Us, and the chewable kind is often even worse — and bad for our teeth. We know we should really keep up with some kind of multivitamin though. It becomes more and more important the older we get, and if we’re currently staying home for an indefinite period of time, the importance is at an all-time high!</p><p>So, let’s talk liquid supplements. Many of us don’t even consider that our daily multivitamin can come in another form…and that that other form might be better in just about every way. Sure, the actual act of taking a liquid supplement is easier, but there’s so much more. Take <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this premium multivitamin</a> from Tropical Oasis. The brand claims it will be absorbed by your body up to 98%, while pills and capsules may only be absorbed 3 to 18%. That’s a major difference!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tropical Oasis Mega Premium Liquid Multivitamin</a> (originally $40) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$33</a> at Amazon with free shipping!

Quite the opposite, in fact!</p><p>This multivitamin, which contains a 32-day supply, is made in the USA and cold-water processed to maintain the quality of the ingredients. Those ingredients? Pretty much everything to keep your body healthy and spry.
