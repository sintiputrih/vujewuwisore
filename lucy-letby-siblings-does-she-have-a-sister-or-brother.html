But when she was arrested in 2018, her career came to an abrupt stop.</p><p>The public and medical community were taken aback by the claims against her, which brought to light the sharp contrast between her caring persona and the offenses she was allegedly charged with.</p><p>Letby was found guilty of killing infants between June 2015 and June 2016 while he was employed at the hospital.</p><p>Letby wept, reflecting on the relatives of her victims who consoled one another as the jury read out the findings.</p><p>One of the jurors wept and buried her face in her hands.
