The &nbsp;<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess of Wales</a></strong> is renowned for her impeccable style, and her love for Chanel is no secret. With an innate sense of elegance, Princess Kate often opts for Chanel's timeless designs, showcasing her admiration for the brand's classic aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaxwB9stIL data-wc=112>Last year she wore a vintage blue tweed jacket by Chanel which was first released in 1995. (Iconic.) As the Princess becomes more established in her role, her attitude towards occasion dressing has evolved into a refined regality. We couldn’t have imagined her rocking an electric blue vintage Chanel number at the beginning of her tenure as royal girlfriend, but now that Kate has matured into a bonafide style icon and future Queen it couldn’t seem a more appropriate move. This wasn't the first time she’s championed the French luxury maison however. Although Kate tends to favour British brands (for obvious reasons) she has on several occasions donned the Coco Chanel-founded label.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Princess Kate wore a new Chanel bag to the Rugby World Cup and you probably missed it" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/124030e63846-gettyimages-1258843272.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Princess Kate wore a new Chanel bag to the Rugby World Cup and you probably missed it" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Princess Kate wore a new Chanel bag to the Rugby World Cup and you probably missed it</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Queen received this iconic Chanel perfume for her 29th birthday" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e188a7e47370-gettyimages-82033876.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Queen received this iconic Chanel perfume for her 29th birthday" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Queen received this iconic Chanel perfume for her 29th birthday</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ecB6WLTzmBw data-wc=46>Whether attending royal engagements or casual outings, Kate effortlessly incorporates Chanel pieces into her wardrobe, from iconic tweed jackets to sophisticated quilted handbags.
