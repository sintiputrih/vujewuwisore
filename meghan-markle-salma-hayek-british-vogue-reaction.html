Take Salma Hayek, for example, who was one of the 15 women and "Forces for Change" selected by the duchess to star on the cover of the September issue. When she first got the call to be involved in the project, she wasn't even allowed to say the duchess's name to the people with her at the time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Editor-in-Chief Edward Enninful, one of Hayek's longtime friends, told her on the phone, "You cannot say the name of the person I'm calling," before he added Duchess Meghan on the line. "Frankly, I thought it was a joke," Hayek told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/entertainment/salma-hayek-pinault-meghan-markle-british-vogue/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">CNN</a>. She thought Enninful would put their close friend Naomi Campbell on the call instead. But, nope, it was Meghan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hayek had to maintain that high level of secrecy throughout the months-long process. "I couldn't talk about it and I didn't," she told CNN. She didn't tell her husband, daughter, publicist, or even the other women Meghan chose to star on the magazine cover.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I felt very honored when we did this photo shoot. No one else knew what it was for," she said. "Only me and the photographer, Peter Lindbergh, knew. And all the girls were getting their picture taken for the cover and they didn't know that Meghan was how they got there."</p><img alt=BRITAIN-ROYALS-MEGHAN-FASHION title=BRITAIN-ROYALS-MEGHAN-FASHION width=3992 height=2639 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/this-undated-handout-photo-issued-on-july-28-2019-by-news-photo-1158324066-1564676845.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">@SUSSEXROYAL</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Meghan working behind the scenes with the charity Smart Works.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although she couldn't talk about the top-secret issue, Hayek was honored to be involved. She said the Duchess of Sussex was "very kind and loving and easy going" when she first introduced herself on the phone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I got excited," Hayek added. "I'm thinking and I'm trying to find the logic to this strange day. She explained her passion for women and what's happening currently."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meghan also revealed that Hayek—an actress, producer, women's rights activist, and advocate for refugees—was one of her first choices to star in the issue. "I was like completely shocked," Hayek recalled. "I did not see it coming that way. She started talking about how she's been watching me and why me."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Royal Fashion | Royal Tea with Rickey Thompson" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2019-harpersbazaar-royalteawithrickythompson-ep03-royalfashion-ldm-v9-facebook-1558551914.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
