I can’t handle that.’ I went through laboring for six hours naturally at home. Right there in a big old pool. Don’t worry, it wasn’t on the carpet.”</p><p>The A New Model author went on to write via Instagram: “Nothing prepares you for just how magical and intense giving birth is; I’m so grateful that I was able to deliver naturally in my home with my husband by my side for all 6 hours of labor. Holding my baby for the first time is a moment I’ll never forget.”</p><p>Since showing off her son for the first time, the Nebraska native has shared many sweet shots on social media breast-feeding her boy, from <a href=#>family photos</a> to candid cafe pics.</p><p>Graham has also been honest about her postpartum experience, describing <a href=#>changing her own diapers</a> and <a href=#>not shaving her armpits</a>.</p><p>“After all these years in fashion I never could’ve guessed that disposable underwear would be my favorite piece of clothing but here we are!” the new mom captioned a mirror selfie. “No one talks about the recovery and healing (yes even the messy parts) new moms go through. I wanted to show you guys that it’s not all rainbows and butterflies! It’s been tough.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Graham and Ervin, 31, wed in 2010.

Now that we’ve made a life together, let’s make a life together. I love you and I love us. All of us.”</p><p>Two years later, the pair<a href=#> announced that they were pregnant</a> with twins. <a href=#>Malachi and Roman arrived in January 2022</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the model breast-feeding their babies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkrrS0y56wZp%2BilrWiudJmqrCdlamytMCMm6memaOpeqexxJ2gp59dqLWwwNJmrqKsmGLAsLqMoqqamZNiu7a%2B0qKloGWRoa%2B2uY6gqaKmnp67qHnArWShnaJitLbFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
