Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your data migration tool.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-how-we-tested-the-best-data-migration-tools><span>How we tested the best data migration tools</span></h3><p>To test for the best data migration tools we first set up an account with the relevant software platform. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used with different files and folders, from different devices, in different situations. The aim was to push each data migration platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/news/how-we-test>Read how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar</a>.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-get-in-touch><span>Get in touch</span></h3><ul><li>You've reached the end of the page.
