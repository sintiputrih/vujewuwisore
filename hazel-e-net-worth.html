In a recent interview on the It’s Tricky With Raquel Harper podcast, the 41-year-old shared that things got shaky with her and Winnie Harlow after insults about her appearance were made.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the war of words started after rapper and actor LightSkinKeisha posted pictures of Hazel on Instagram and said that she looked like Ernest P. Worrell from the Ernest movies. That’s when Winnie reportedly chimed in and said, “Keisha, no," in a teasing manner.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While the comment seemed harmless in nature, Hazel caught wind of it all and quickly clapped back. Hazel then said to Winnie, “Listen here, 101 Dalmatians.” Yikes.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, Winnie has Vitiligo, a skin condition that causes discolored patches on your skin, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayo Clinic</a>. So, that insult was pretty low for Hazel to respond with. And of course, Hazel didn’t stop there.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"In real life, if Tyra Banks didn't feel sorry for your malnourished a--, no one would know you! Pipe down, Salt-N-Pepa,” Hazel added on.</p><p>In her interview with Raquel, she shared that the two have not made up and that she’s not sorry for what she said.</p><p>“I just felt that, for you to jump into the situation and [make a joke] about me ... like don't [joke] about me,” Hazel said. “Because when I came, she was like, ‘Oh no, no, no.’ She backtracked out the whole situation, because I’m going to annihilate.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After Raquel shared that she may have gone a bit too far, Hazel didn't back down from her comments.</p><p>“If people are going to make fun of me for ... appearances and things I can’t control — I couldn’t control the nose I was born with or the size of my shoulders — that means nothing is off limits.”</p><p>Well, it appears that Hazel will not be apologizing for her insults anytime soon. As for Winnie, the model has yet to respond to the interview, but she'll likely take the high road.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna67sctmnGamlal6uLvRrZ8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
