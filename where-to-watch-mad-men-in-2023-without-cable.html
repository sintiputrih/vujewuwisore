The show cemented <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Jon Hamm as the charismatic but deeply flawed Don Draper</a>, a 1960s advertising professional. Thanks to Elisabeth Moss’ Peggy Olson, an up-and-comer at Sterling Cooper who is essentially a co-protagonist, we are given a feminist deconstruction of the patriarchic society in which the firm operates. It’s a show known as much for its intellect as it is for its jaw-dropping dramatic twists and unflinching look into the somewhat raunchy underbelly that defined a pre-hippie generation.</p><h2 id=h-where-can-i-stream-mad-men data-injectable=false>Where can I stream Mad Men?</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>15 years ago today, we met the world’s greatest pitch man.</p><p>Tell us your favorite moments from the series. <a href=#>#MadMen</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RbmNIVrZRz</a></p>— AMC+ (@AMCPlus) <a href=#>July 19, 2022</a><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Now that you’re no doubt completely on board for checking out Mad Men yourself, there are numerous outlets for you to catch up on the series that originally ran from 2007-2015. For one thing, you could always buy individual episodes or entire seasons via platforms such as Amazon and Vudu, which offer all seven seasons. Episodes usually cost $1.99 with whole seasons going for $9.99. However, there is another option: streaming.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Currently, Mad Men is not available via a typical outlet like Netflix. However, if you’re willing to expand your horizons, you could subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AMC Plus</a>, a proprietary streaming platform for the cable network that gains you access to not only Mad Men but also other quality programs like The Walking Dead Dead City and Creepshow as well as great movies constantly added in a regular rotation of content.</p><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>The starting price for AMC Plus — which includes full access to Shudder, Sundance Now, and IFC Films Unlimited — begins at $4.99 per month, though you’ll have to contend with ads. There is an ad-free tier for $8.99 per month which has the added benefit of being able to download content to your device. It also works out to be a cheaper monthly rate, at $6.99 per month, if you choose the premium tier via an annual bill of $83.88. Whatever the case, any subscription you get comes with six live TV channels as well.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>To use AMC Plus, you can experience it via a web browser on your computer or download the AMC Plus app to your device.
