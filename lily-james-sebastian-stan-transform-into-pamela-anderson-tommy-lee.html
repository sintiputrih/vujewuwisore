The show also stars <a href=#><strong>Seth Rogen</strong></a>, <strong>Nick Offerman</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Taylor Schilling</strong></a>, <strong>Andrew Dice Clay</strong>, <strong>Pepi Sonuga</strong>, <strong>Spencer Granese</strong> and <strong>Mozhan Marnò</strong>.</p><p>Anderson, 53, and Lee, 58, were married from 1995 to 1998. They share sons <a href=#><strong>Brandon</strong></a>, 24, and <a href=#><strong>Dylan</strong></a>, 23.</p><p>The Baywatch alum reflected on the infamous video during a May 2020 appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “That was <a href=#>not a sex tape</a>,” she insisted at the time. “It was a compilation of vacations that we were naked on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lily-James-Transform-Into-Pamela-Anderson-in-First-Photos-From-Pam-Tommy.jpg><p>The tape, which showed the couple on their honeymoon, was stolen from Anderson and Lee’s home and released in 1995. She sued the video distribution company, and the two agreed to a confidential settlement. The company later made the video available on its websites again.</p><p>Anderson secretly wed her bodyguard <a href=#><strong>Dan Hayhurst</strong></a> in December 2020 after her brief marriage to <a href=#><strong>Jon Peters</strong></a> earlier that year, which was not legal. She was also previously married to <a href=#><strong>Kid Rock</strong></a> from 2006 to 2007 and <strong>Rick Salomon</strong> from 2007 to 2008 and again from 2014 to 2015. Lee, for his part, <a href=#>tied the knot</a> with <a href=#><strong>Brittany Furlan</strong></a> in February 2019.</p><p>News broke in December 2020 that James and Stan were set to play Anderson and Lee in the series. Some fans reacted skeptically via Twitter at the time.</p><p>“Okay, there better be some serious transformations for Sebastian Stan and Lily James for them to look like Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee because right now, not seeing it,” one person tweeted.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Another suggested that <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Florence Pugh</strong></a> would have been better in the roles, writing, “I’m not saying someone made a mistake with the Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson casting but I’m just offering an alternative that seems far superior.”</p><p>Meanwhile, a third Twitter user predicted the transformations would “require tremendous makeup work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOipKlit6K5xKxkrJ2SlsC1tcCnZKyskaN6tb7Ap6qfp6Kieqq606hkqZmdmrmiecCnm56qo6S7bsDOpqSyZZyasnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
