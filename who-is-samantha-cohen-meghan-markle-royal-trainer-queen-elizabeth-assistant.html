Their schedule often includes traveling the country and meeting with charities, as royals usually do.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Markle apparently actually started meeting with Cohen after she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in November.
