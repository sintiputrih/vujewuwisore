While there is a long list of these codes (such as 1007, 7031, 8020, 9074, etc.), they all have similar solutions, mostly related to software, hardware, cables, or the quality of your internet connection. Should you have an error code disrupt your viewing, try the following advice to see if any of these things could be at fault.</p><ul id=GUID-9A6F9AC7-42FD-480A-AD8E-B6DB0D469E8F__STEPS-UNORDERED_A6A237CD1B0A4946B42DAD822576BAC6 class="a-unordered-list a-vertical"><li>Exit<span class=a-list-item><span id=GUID-9A6F9AC7-42FD-480A-AD8E-B6DB0D469E8F__GUID-93FE69CF-B542-4844-8211-BD2EFDD8B77D> the Prime Video app on your smart TV, console, tablet, smartphone, or PC and restart it.

Since mobile devices and smartphones have proprietary apps and operating systems to access services like Amazon Prime Video, they have their own unique solutions. Performing a hard reset will often clear up your problems, but here’s how to fix them in case that doesn’t help.</p><h3>Amazon Prime Video on Android</h3><p>Clearing the app data can often resolve connection issues on <a href=# data-injected=1>Android</a>. Tap Settings > Apps/Application Manager > Amazon Video. Tap Clear Data, then tap OK. Note that you may also have to sign out of the app and sign in again (as well as with Amazon Underground, if you make use of it). You can also try resetting your mobile internet connection by putting your device in airplane mode for a few seconds. Also, make sure you’re running the latest version of the app. If all else fails, delete the app and reinstall it.</p><h3>Amazon Prime Video on iOS</h3><p>For iPad and iPhone users, restarting the app, re-downloading Amazon Prime Video content, deleting the app, and reinstalling are the only options. You can also try resetting your mobile internet connection by putting your device in airplane mode for a few seconds. Also, make sure you’re running the latest version of the app.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnbyusYytn56ZpJq%2FcK%2FOpqSopl2WuqLGzqdkqaqZorJuwsidnKhloKe8o7jEpqpmmZ6Zeqm71marqGWWnsVuwMeepGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
