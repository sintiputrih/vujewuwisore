When somebody has got that, that’s when they’ve got swagger and are sexy. You don't have to hide it. You can let them show it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b26fff8edebc-gettyimages-2010767776.jpg><p id=ecJCpY-iNKY data-wc=59>Costume designer John Glaser added: “We kept those elements of the long coat and the swagger and movement like a pirate. He’s like Errol Flynn. Somebody that’s pretty dapper but not wearing nice suits. We also took away a lot of the ruffles, anything that was feminine, and kept everything that was as masculine as we could on him.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Best Bridgerton gifts - at a glance</h3><p id=etNIQZnI-Yf><strong>The cute Bridgerton biscuits</strong> - Biscuiteers Bridgerton Letterbox Biscuits, <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">£27.50</a></span> / <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">$54</a></span></p><p id=eXfFO8B3Scz><strong>The Bridgerton candle:</strong> Smells Like The Diamond Of The Season Candle, from <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">£20.67</a></span> / from <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">$21.53</a></span></p><p id=ec8TMtyVzMv><strong>The Colin Bridgerton T-shirt:&nbsp;</strong>Cotton T-shirt, from <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">£20.46</a></span> / from <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">$25.60</a></span></p><p id=e8VJN_Ybom6><strong>The Bridgerton Book Set:</strong> The Bridgerton Collection: Books 1-4 by Julia Quinn, <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">£28.99</a></span> / <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">$42.09</a></span></p><p id=eajB36_PYMR><strong>The Bridgerton Mug</strong>: Lady Whistledown Spill The Tea Mug, from <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">£15</a></span> / from <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">$15</a></span></p><p id=erso166z_2WF data-wc=66>Chatting to Vogue, he added: “If you look at the first two seasons, Colin wears a lot of baby blues. But now, he’s been on a trip for six months, and he’s been in the cabin of a ship. In reality, he’d be smelly, his clothes would be dirty, he’d be unshaven – but, this is Bridgeton, so you have to glamorise it a little bit.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6e56d36cd450-bridgerton-season-three-pen-and-colin.jpg><p id=eAdedZVMJmbo data-wc=38>“So, we went straight to the Marlboro Man – we’re not supposed to talk about smoking, but that guy’s on a horse in the dust and dirt.

If you look closely, you’ll notice that her hair in that scene is now a slightly different shade of red.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7eb30222258b-bridgerton306unit01105rcjpgbridgerton306unit01105rc.jpg><p id=e9r7xEt3iu95 data-wc=77>“The underlayer of that outfit is actually an iridescent fabric that’s green and copper, and it sort of blends in with her hair. After that, for her new look, we wanted softer, more neutral colours. Are her dresses green? Are they blue? We didn’t want to reveal anything about where her story might be going… We also pushed her a little forward in time, to 1817, in terms of her silhouette, and dropped the empire waist.” Stunning!&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
