In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Comics</a>, Kang has a number of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">odd variants</a>, including a teenager who comes to the past from the 31st century to prevent his future domination.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=541 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Kang was born Nathaniel Richards, a distant descendant of Reed Richards and Sue Storm of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a>. After suffering from constant bullying at school, Nathaniel is visited by his future self who takes him on a journey throughout time, showing him how he will one day rule and conquer everything. Appalled by his future actions, Nathaniel uses the time travel suit Kang gave him to arrive at the present day in hopes of getting help from the Avengers and preventing his future incarnation from causing chaos throughout the timestream.</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>The teenage genius uses Tony Stark’s ideas to make himself a suit, calling himself Iron Lad. Since the Avengers have disbanded, Nathaniel recruits several young heroes – such as Cassie Lang, Kate Bishop, Billy and Tommy – who call themselves the Young Avengers. During his time in the present, young Nathaniel and Cassie Lang develop feelings for one another. Nathaniel eventually realizes he needs to go back to his own timeline, but not before killing one of the many Kang variants and vowing to be a better person.</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>With the introduction of so many young heroes and Kang finally blasting his way into the MCU, now is the prime opportunity to introduce his younger self and form the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Avengers</a>. Based on Johnathan Majors take Kang, here are 10 actors who could believably step into what has to be among the most coveted roles in Hollywood right now. Since Cassie is currently around 18 years old and Kate Bishop is 22, Nathaniel could be cast as a college-aged young man and not necessarily a teenager. For that reason, we’re including actors from teens to 30.</p><h2 id=h-trey-sartorius data-injectable=false><strong>Trey Sartorius</strong></h2><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>The MCU has already cast Trey Sartorius as “Nate” Richards in the upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agatha: Coven of Chaos.</a> Sartorius is a 19-year-old actor and social media personality who is known for his roles in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nickelodeon</a>’s Henry Danger and The Thundermans.

As we know, Kang has many variants and, at the moment, we don’t even know if this is the Nathaniel Richards or a past relative. Although he doesn’t really look like Jonathan Majors, he has a great personality in his YouTube videos, which could definitely make him a good choice to play teenage Kang.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Dallas Dupree Young</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>Dallas Dupree Young is possibly the youngest actor on this list at 16.
