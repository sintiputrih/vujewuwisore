Want proof that we did indeed go through a post-2020 vibe shift? A bunch of people on the internet are rooting against a big, starry Oscar movie — for reasons that have nothing to do with the film’s assumed politics.

The Academy may pretend that the Oscars is purely about celebrating the very best in the craft, but we know better. This is a competition, and as such, deciding who you’ll root against is almost as much fun as deciding who you’ll root for.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55nt4x00113b7yyg0t60zg@published data-word-count=141>I came of age as a pundit during the Trump presidency, which heightened the stakes of the villain conversation. For right-thinking people of the era, the success of films like&nbsp;<a href=#>La La Land</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Green Book</a>&nbsp;was proof not just that awards voters didn’t share their tastes, but of something rotten in the country itself. I don’t want to suggest that we’re in a less polarized moment now or that people have developed healthier attitudes about art. (<a href=#>Last week’s&nbsp;Barbie&nbsp;kerfuffle</a>&nbsp;should disabuse us of that notion.) But I do think it’s a positive development that the 2024 Oscar villain is a throwback to the seasons of yore, when people rooted against a title on purely <a href=#>aesthetic</a> grounds. This year, one unlucky film became the Oscar villain simply because it was boring, basic, and a little pretentious. That’s right — I’m talking about&nbsp;<a href=#>Maestro</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55nt7600123b7yobz6yy7b@published data-word-count=86>Though I’ve made it my job to follow these things, I confess I did not see the&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;backlash coming. I caught up with the Leonard Bernstein biopic a week after it played the New York Film Festival in October, and while it wasn’t my favorite of this year’s awards crop, I admired the formal inventiveness, the commitment to period mannerisms, and <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a>’s evident love of flirting onscreen. It seemed to me like a fairly standard Oscar movie, which is precisely what everybody else hates about it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55nt9j00133b7ybdd3stwh@published data-word-count=187>The thing&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;detractors often say is that they have no idea why the film was made, except to win awards. My answer to this is that&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;is about a straight woman and a gay man who fall for each other, and instead of using each other for clout the way they would today, decide to get married. It’s about how going into a relationship with your eyes fully open is still no defense against getting hurt. To me, that’s as valid a subject for a movie as any. Sounds swell, my friends say, but absolutely none of that has been communicated to the general public. To those who haven’t seen it,&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;is a movie about how Cooper spent untold amounts of time and money transforming himself into a very important conductor, in a movie about how this conductor was very important. (The private life of Leonard Bernstein is, as Cousin Greg might say, not IP many of them are familiar with.) And thanks to Netflix’s characteristic largesse, the film has also become impossible to ignore. Drive past a billboard, take the subway, browse the internet, and there’s Cooper, baton blazing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55ntbj00143b7yrproiiea@published data-word-count=115>Few of those who have seen the film have rallied to its defense. I’ve heard grumbles from older members of the Hollywood Establishment that&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;sidelines Bernstein’s art and activism, the very things that made him important. In&nbsp;<a href=#>The New Yorker</a>, Richard Brody said that the film “leaves out the good stuff.” And Cooper’s allusive direction has bugged even those less invested in the tale. As&nbsp;<a href=#>one redditor</a>&nbsp;put it, the film’s attempt to swerve around biopic clichés left it feeling as if it had been assembled “entirely from deleted scenes and outtakes.” Consensus is that the film is technically marvelous but cold, as if Cooper spent such time studying Bernstein’s tics that he lost sight of the man’s soul.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55nte500153b7yoyas4ko2@published data-word-count=138>Above all, the thing that seems to be bugging people about&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;is Cooper himself. Not since Anne Hathaway has an Oscar contender lost so much goodwill simply by campaigning so hard. Now, Cooper has not been alone on the awards trail. Cillian Murphy is not sitting at home in monkish penury. Paul Giamatti has not taken a vow of silence in honor of Thespis. But Cooper has accidentally violated one of the cardinal rules of campaigning: Show you want it, but don’t be desperate. Thus even standard celebrity behavior has been filtered through an unflattering lens. Fans side-eyed his extremely public romance with Gigi Hadid, saw&nbsp;<a href=#>shade</a>&nbsp;toward Murphy in his&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;“Actors on Actors” interview, and passed around&nbsp;<a href=#>blind items</a>&nbsp;hinting at diva behavior behind the scenes. Through strange awards-season alchemy, the combination of&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;and Cooper’s star persona has made the public recoil from both.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55ntg900163b7y7vkv0fbx@published data-word-count=47>For while&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;has been dinged for not revealing much about Bernstein, I suspect in its naked stretch for greatness it is a little too revealing about Cooper. At the risk of psychoanalyzing a stranger, it’s worth digging into his teacher’s-pet intensity, the quality many observers find so off-putting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55ntjr00173b7y8e0dueoi@published data-word-count=111>Like Taylor Swift, another try-hard frequently seen at NFL games this season, Cooper hails from the upper-middle-class suburbs of Philadelphia — a world I can speak to, because it’s the world I come from too. (Both of my siblings attended the same private high school as Cooper.) This is an environment where the dream of meritocracy still holds sway, where a smart kid from a well-off family could believe that if he studied hard enough his dreams were indeed within his grasp. Cooper was exposed to the work of Bernstein as a child; as a young adult he matriculated at Georgetown, rowed crew, studied abroad in France.&nbsp;Mare of Easttown&nbsp;this was not.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55ntm000183b7yt6e7m9a0@published data-word-count=126>Yet although he had high-culture ambitions, even studying at the famed Actors Studio, Cooper’s early-Hollywood forays came at the other end of the industry. His first regular gig was playing a beta on&nbsp;Alias. His first big movie role was as a douchebag in&nbsp;Wedding Crashers. The film that made him a star was&nbsp;The Hangover. By the time Cooper was able to open a movie, his A-list peers — guys like Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, and Joaquin Phoenix — had been famous for over a decade. By the time&nbsp;The Hangover: Part II&nbsp;hit theaters, that trio had racked up six Oscar nominations between them. Is it any wonder that when Cooper was finally granted access to the world of prestige cinema he would be desperate to prove he belonged?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55nto200193b7y4n129aqz@published data-word-count=97>The New York&nbsp;Times’ Kyle Buchanan&nbsp;<a href=#>noted</a>&nbsp;that, on both of his big Oscar plays, Cooper has run a director campaign, not an actor campaign. Rather than trying to dazzle with charisma in the manner of Giamatti or Colman Domingo, his narrative highlights his diligent preparation, his intense focus. This has earned him the approval of elders like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, though, so far, not the directors’ branch. I heard rumors about Cooper being a bit of a pill on the&nbsp;Star Is Born&nbsp;campaign, and if he goes home empty-handed yet again, we may hear similar stories this year.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55nttw001a3b7y5fb7evjo@published data-word-count=126>The irony here is that, for all Cooper’s strenuous efforts,&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;has managed to become the season’s official villain without ever being a legitimate threat. The film hasn’t won many precursors, and though the Academy nominated it in seven categories, including Best Picture, it’s considered a long shot in most of them. (The one exception is Makeup & Hairstyling, where makeup maestro&nbsp;<a href=#>Kazu Hiro</a>&nbsp;is favored to win his third trophy.) What makes this even funnier is that the film that&nbsp;is&nbsp;dominating all comers this season is&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;— another warts-and-all biopic of a Great Man from the 20th century, which also features a jumbled timeline and black-and-white cinematography, and whose director is likewise often accused of taking himself too seriously. By all rights,&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;should have become the season’s biggest villain. Why didn’t it?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55ntw1001b3b7y9y3g8vui@published data-word-count=127>First and foremost is&nbsp;Barbenheimer. Though I’ve heard whispers that Team&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;were not the biggest fans of the meme, which they felt trivialized the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there’s no doubt the summer phenomenon inoculated Christopher Nolan’s film from an Oscar-villain backlash. It helped make&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;a hit, giving it the feel of a winner from day one. By treating the films as a linked pair, the meme also undercut the budding gender essentialism around them; just as&nbsp;Barbie&nbsp;became for the boys, so too did&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;become for the girls, gays, and theys. And crucially, the craze added an element of fun around what is, let’s face it, a fairly gray and dour film. The internet could not pretend that&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;was being shoved down their necks, because they’d already claimed it as their own.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cls55nty9001c3b7ysp7aa1gl@published data-word-count=65>This all could change if&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;keeps winning absolutely everything. (In the wake of&nbsp;Barbie’s snubs, I’m starting to notice&nbsp;<a href=#>uncharitable readings</a>&nbsp;of Nolan’s quotes, an important leading indicator.) Of course, there’s no reason either&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;or&nbsp;Maestro&nbsp;had to wind up this year’s Oscar villain. But the fact that the latter did and the former did not tells us something: Intellectual pretension is acceptable in our awards vehicles; emotional pretension far less so.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clr6im2bi00000idas5pfflio@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>What Is a Bradley Cooper Film?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clrzefadi00000idgj0yvu5ma@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>How Mad Should I Be About Barbie’s Oscar Nominations?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clrave0bj00130ii4nal19wlw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Can Anyone Stop Oppenheimer at the Oscars?</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Why Maestro Became an Oscar Villain (and Oppenheimer Didn’t)</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbWdgZ3y4tNhmpJqdo6m%2FsHnBnpqapZVirq95zqyamqpdq7atuMCipWaZnpl6sLzPnqWhnZmisrN5w6Kbp6xencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
