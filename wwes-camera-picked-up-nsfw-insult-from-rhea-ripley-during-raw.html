During that match, Rhea Ripley was on hand to assist in any way she could. This included mocking their opponents in whatever way she wanted.</p><p>While the Judgment Day wrestle Cedric Alexander and Shelton Benjamin, Rhea Ripley had a little extra taunt in the chamber. The camera clearly picked up her calling to Alexander to say he is a “dickhead.”</p><p>This insult was likely not scripted, so it’s unclear exactly how Triple H felt about it. If anything, “dickhead” isn’t the kind of insult that WWE generally scripts for their talent, so this improvised word was likely all Rhea Ripley’s idea.</p><p>We’ll have to see if any other mention of this is made in the future. In the meantime, it certainly made for an entertaining clip.
