We’ll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each beginning, but unless you truly want to maximise your playtime, you’ll probably get the greatest enjoyment out of the game if you choose the Pokémon that you adore.</p><p>After clearing up the disclaimer, let’s examine who Arceus’s true best starter Pokémon is.</p><h3>Pokémon Legends Arceus: Why Cyndaquil is the Best Starter Pokémon</h3><p>Why the best starter is Cyndaquil in Pokémon Legends Arceus Cyndaquil, a fire-type Pokémon first seen in Generation 2, can ultimately use Ghost-type moves after evolving in to Hisuian Typhlosion.</p><p>Cyndaquil is able to evolve into its second form faster than the other starters, which is very handy once you start to face those mid-game difficulty spikes (fire-type Pokémon nearly always have an advantage in that area). It scales well into the late game since its final form has a larger stat pool than the final forms of the other beginning Pokémon.</p><p>It’s also important to note that although though wild fire-type Pokémon are a touch more prevalent in Arceus than they are in earlier Pokémon games, you might still justifiably choose Cyndaquil because he’ll be your best fire-type option for a while.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pjimage-6-1.jpg alt width=768 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Pokémon Legends Arceus: Why Oshawott is the Best Starter Pokémon</h3><p>Oshawott, a water-type Pokémon first seen in Pokémon Black and White, evolves into Hisuian Samurott, a Pokémon with dark-type abilities.</p><p>Oshawott, like certain other water-type Pokémon, is a usually wise choice that excels in the early game because of an early inflow of rock-type foes. Oshawott’s evolutions may appear to be slightly “weaker” than those of its rivals in terms of stats, but they are frequently more potent than they appear because to their strong water/dark skillset and range of buff and debuff abilities. To be fair, Oshawott’s two evolution forms are among the most visually appealing in the entire game.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ufd3d18415569a3e6150976dcf710939b><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Pokémon Legends: Arceus' The Reason Behind The Hisuian Typhlosion Form</span></a><p>Water-type Pokémon aren’t hard to find all around Arceus, but Oshawott is still your best choice for finding them when they’re most advantageous early in the game.</p><h3>Pokémon Legends Arceus: Why Rowlet is the Best Starter Pokémon</h3><p>Rowlet from Pokémon Sun and Moon may be adorable, but they also carry a powerful punch because they’re the only starter Pokémon to start with two different ability kinds (grass and flying, which changes to grass and fighting when Rowlet develops).</p><p>Rowlet can handle a number of early threats with to their special dual-type setup and excellent base stats, and they almost always play a part in your party even in the late game. They also transform into their ultimate form more quickly than any other starting, which is quite advantageous given that their final form is surprisingly potent in comparison to other starters.</p><h3>Rowlet vs. Oshawott vs. Cyndaquil: Who is the Best Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Arceus?</h3><p>Pokémon games frequently conceal “difficulty levels” behind the Pokémon you choose as your starting Pokémon, making the game either easier or harder depending on your selection. With Arceus, however, this is not always the case. In a moment, we’ll discuss some of the benefits and drawbacks of choosing particular Pokémon, but it’s unlikely that you’ll ever wish you had chosen a different Pokémon after encountering a challenge that your chosen Pokémon is unable to overcome. In light of this, it is totally acceptable to choose a beginning Pokémon based only on aesthetic considerations (even if they do seem incredibly great).</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ucaf13e81110670be995efb6d909243f4><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Pokémon Legends: Arceus' The Reason Behind The Hisuian Typhlosion Form</span></a><p>Having saying that, your beginning Pokémon will have a significant impact on Arceus’ early game.</p><p>Arceus doesn’t have gym leaders, but you will come across several Noble Pokémon that resemble bosses and have their own types. Technically, Oshawott has a type advantage over more early Noble Pokémon, whereas Rowlet has none and Cyndaquil gives very little. Again, though, you’ll have a full roster of Pokémon to choose from in no time, and there aren’t any early-game obstacles that are so incredibly challenging that you’ll make life much more difficult for yourself just because you selected one Pokémon over the other. This time, there are also no competing trainers to be concerned about.</p><p>Oshawott is most likely the best starter Pokémon if you want to sail through the early game. Despite having lower starting numbers, they have a clear type advantage over many other early game threats. However, if you count on them to be your primary water-type Pokémon in the late game, they do scale relatively badly.</p><p>Cyndaquil might be the best option if you don’t mind having to wait a bit longer for your starter to really realise their full potential. Around the time of his first evolution, he truly starts to shine, and even in comparison to the notable fire-types that will also be accessible at that time, it’s difficult to dispute the strength of his final form.</p><p>Rowlet is somewhat unpredictable. Despite the lack of clear type advantages in early encounters, their skills and powerful stats are helpful in the early game, and they are adaptable enough to fit into any late-game team. They won’t really “take over” in the same way as the others might, but I can definitely imagine someone arguing that they’re actually the greatest starter because they frequently prove beneficial at different points in the game.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ue3b10a71d4baff76642cb6a42eeea50d><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Pokémon Legends: Arceus' The Reason Behind The Hisuian Typhlosion Form</span></a><p>Here is how I think the rankings will pan out after all is said and done.</p><p>3. Oshawa, AB</p><p>Cyndaquil 2.</p><p>Rowlet 1.</p><p>However, unless you absolutely want the biggest early-game edge imaginable, I’d suggest that Cyndaquil and Rowlet provide more overall. Again, that rating is based more on stats and fighting potential than the many amount of minor considerations that will finally determine the ideal beginning Pokémon for you. Due to their excellent base numbers and surprising adaptability, Rowlet has a modest advantage.</p><p>For what it’s worth, throughout your Arceus adventure you will also have the opportunity to capture the other beginning Pokémon, so don’t worry too much about losing the “one that got away.”</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
