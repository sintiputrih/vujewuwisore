This was before the show improved, so deep down, we kind of wanted everyone to get zombified. Some of our death prayers were answered (sorry, T-Dog — not sorry, Lori), and since the improvements, we have actually ended up changing our minds about some of the survivors. With the second half of the season starting Sunday at 9 p.m., we felt it best to reexamine our death wishes. Here is an updated ranking of whom we want to live, in descending order: favorite character on top, person who we will personally eat if they stick around much longer on the bottom.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-3-0-0@published data-word-count=17><b><span>(From top to bottom: Whom we most want to live to whom we most want to die)</span></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-4-0-0@published data-word-count=75><b>Daryl Dixon<br></b><span>Obviously, Double-D is generally considered the best character, but more than that, this ranking reflects the feeling that he might actually get killed this season. Not only did we last see him supposedly about to fight his brother to the death, but also the appearance of Tyreese at the jail (see below) might mean Daryl’s role in the group is no longer needed. We really hope Daryl and his crossbow make it through.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-5-0-0@published data-word-count=67><b>Tyreese<br></b><span>We don’t know tons about <a href=#>Tyreese</a>, but in his one appearance, when he and his troupe of survivors arrived at the jail in the mid-season finale, he instantly seemed better than basically every other character on the show. (Plus, his <i>Wire</i> credentials as having played Cutty reflexively get him a pass.) To have a character that is super intimidating </span><i>and</i><span> not extremely cynical will be refreshing.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-6-0-0@published data-word-count=31><b>The Governor<br></b><span>Shows need bad guys, and the Governor is a great one. (He even wears an eye patch.)

For all the hype about her, she’s been kind of annoying, <a href=#>one-note scowly</a>, and particularly irrational. We don’t want her to die just yet, but maybe soon.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-12-0-0@published data-word-count=25><b>Maggie Greene<br></b><span>Maggie is kind of the middle point between people we want to die and people we want to live.

We like Glenn. But shows like </span><i>TWD</i><span> sometimes need to kill off beloved characters. So, if it has to happen, we’d rather it be Glenn than Daryl.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-14-0-0@published data-word-count=37><b>Merle Dixon<br></b><span>Screw Merle. Bad guys are important, but ones who are completely evil, like Merle, get tiresome. Give him a couple of episodes of doing some bad stuff and then have some zombies eat his face.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-15-0-0@published data-word-count=35><b>Carl Grimes<br></b><span>Just the fact that Carl isn’t last on this list says something. His character has improved a great deal. As he gets more vicious and cold, we might actually grow to like him.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4f3d1e813782cc311bb9075f8326418d-16-0-0@published data-word-count=19><b>Beth Greene<br></b><span>Carl’s transformation would only be hastened if Beth gets killed.

Maybe it’s his thin glasses frames or how smug he was about that zombie remembering things from when he was alive. Maybe he won’t die in the next episode or the episode after, but when he does, zombie-cheers will heard across northern Georgia. (They’ll sound like: “Brain brains brain brains: Brai-brai BRA-INS!
