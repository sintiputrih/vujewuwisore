James Charles was once known for his creative makeup looks and A-list collaborations, but the YouTube star has recently made headlines for a much more dramatic reason — his feud with fellow YouTuber Tati Westbrook.
On Friday, May 10, Westbrook, 37, uploaded a tell-all video titled “BYE SISTER …” and slammed Charles, 19, for inappropriate behavior, manipulation and more. She also asserted that she does not want to be associated with him in the future, even though they were once very close."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She also asserted that she does not want to be associated with him in the future, even though they were once very close.</p><p>“I just don’t think that he does [care for me],” she said in the 43-minute video. “I’m crushed because this person was family to me. This person was someone that I absolutely loved, cared for and would have spent all the time in the world protecting. But he’s just too far gone at this point and the behavior that I don’t even think I can talk about … are so gross, that I don’t think I can protect that.”</p><p>Hours later, the New York native posted his own video and apologized to Westbrook and her husband, James. “I hate knowing that I disappointed not only [fans], but, most importantly, two people who have been role models to me,” Charles said. “I’m going to keep trying my best and keep learning and growing.”</p><p>The Alone Together actor has since been <a href=#>silent on social media</a>, but that has not stopped other beauty gurus from speaking out publicly about the situation. “He is a danger to society,” <a href=#><strong>Jeffree Star</strong> tweeted and deleted</a> on Sunday, May 12. “Everything Tati said is 100% true.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Gabriel Zamora</strong>, on the other hand, defended Charles and claimed that Westbrook did not tell the whole truth.
