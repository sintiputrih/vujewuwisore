She invites him to meet her close friend Paul at a dinner which Benedict believes is to win Paul’s approval of him - but the pair actually have ulterior motives.</p><figure class="videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff -recommended-video"><span class=videoPlayerStyleHeader_v1l4r7u3>Recommended video</span><span class=videoPlayerStyleTitle_v1pm0z4u>You may also like</span>WATCH: Bridgerton series 3’s dramatic hot air balloon scene</figure><p id=etHXIuw58a_ data-wc=70>After enjoying dinner, Benedict asks Paul to call him by his first name, and the pair appear to share a moment. Later, they are enjoying a cigarette on the balcony when Paul tells Benedict that he doesn’t enjoy society events as he finds people judgemental, Benedict replies: “I can’t imagine what anyone would judge for,” to which Paul replies: “Then Tilley has not told you all of our stories.” &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/683e9355f1b7-bridgerton302unit00627r.jpg><p id=eoaukWV6D8B data-wc=42>He adds that Benedict is “rather charming” and it is clear that there is some serious chemistry between the two, leaving Benedict looking somewhat confused. Later, Benedict overhears Paul tell Tilley, “I believe my suspicions are true,” before they share a kiss.&nbsp;</p><p id=evibRJtkJpvg data-wc=107>Spotting Benedict watching, Paul invites Benedict “upstairs” to join them, before Benedict makes up an excuse and leaves. In episode seven, Benedict agrees to enter a polyamorous relationship with the pair, and shares a kiss with Paul. The trio go on to have a relationship before parting ways, with Benedict saying: "I am not certain that serious is what I want... Paul could be Patricia, or Polly, or Peter or all three at once. What happened between the three of us... has made me realise how good it feels to be free. You've opened my world. And I am not ready to close it again just now."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03c4f208b99f-bridgerton203unit05161r.jpg><p id=ej6kBppvuKqA data-wc=40>Fans of Bridgerton have long held a theory that Benedict would be the first Bridgerton sibling to have an LGBTQ storyline, with Luke Thompson, who plays Benedict, also discussing the potential to gender swap the love interest in the novels.&nbsp;</p><p id=egFg5uYzvFot data-wc=29>Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, he said: “Benedict has such a lovely openness and fluidity about him generally, and that’s really, really fun to play because it could go anywhere.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Bridgerton: who will play Benedict's love interest Sophie Beckett in season four?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0a6aab4fae93-hannah-new-luke-thompson-bridgerton.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Bridgerton: who will play Benedict's love interest Sophie Beckett in season four?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Bridgerton: who will play Benedict's love interest Sophie Beckett in season four?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why books fans are already heartbroken watching Bridgerton season 3" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/632c8d2f173d-lord-john-stirling-bridgerton.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why books fans are already heartbroken watching Bridgerton season 3" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why books fans are already heartbroken watching Bridgerton season 3</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Bridgerton: how Benedict's love interest Sophie Beckett will come into season 3" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/39a7b2d92552-bridgerton-split.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Bridgerton: how Benedict's love interest Sophie Beckett will come into season 3" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Bridgerton: how Benedict's love interest Sophie Beckett will come into season 3</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e9sbWuNoNbTC data-wc=36>Chatting to Town & Country, he added: “Benedict is clearly a very open character and that's extremely fun to play.

As such, fans have already suggested that the role could be gender-swapped, with one person posting on X, formerly known as Twitter: “I’m just saying: it would be so easy to gender swap Sophie and make Benedict’s love interest a footman.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/625558b13743-bridgerton303unit00800r.jpg><p id=e6t0az5eeefB data-wc=43>Another person posted: “I'm wondering just how much they'd have to change the story to make this fit, though.

She told PRIDE magazine: “This is a show about love in its many forms, and I think that it’s only right for us to foreground queer love and to tell queer stories. I want to see more queer joy on my screens, and that was definitely a priority for me when I stepped into the showrunner role.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
