We even got a truly canon-breaking development in the final story that gave us <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a surprise multi-Doctor team-up</a>.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>But, despite all we have to be thankful for, there is one way in which the specials left fans a little crestfallen. Fellow fan-favorite Doctor Matt Smith was nowhere to be seen. So why wasn’t the House of the Dragon daddy involved in the Doctor Who 60th anniversary?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matt-smith-coming-back-alongside-david-tennant-would-ve-repaid-a-10-year-old-favor data-injectable=false>Matt Smith coming back alongside David Tennant would’ve repaid a 10-year-old favor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/doctor-who-day-of-the-doctor.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>We weren’t expecting any other modern Doctors to return — Christopher Eccleston has long distanced himself from the series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Capaldi has announced</a> he’d like to move on to other projects, and Jodie Whittaker only just left — but Whovians were sure enough to bet their copious collection of sonic screwdriver toys that Matt Smith would turn up in the anniversary specials somewhere. Anywhere.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>As it happened, he was not to be seen — we didn’t even get a sneaky glimpse at a bowtie or a fez. In many ways, that’s a great shame. For the 50th anniversary special, “The Day of the Doctor,” Tennant was invited back opposite then incumbent lead Smith, so it would’ve been a welcome gesture for Smith to be brought back for Tennant’s new mini-era this November.</p><p data-characters=653 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Unlike Eccleston’s junked return for the 50th, however — John Hurt’s War Doctor was a last-minute addition once the Ninth Doctor actor passed — it seems like there was simply never a place for Smith in the storylines, rather than any kind of snub or scheduling conflict occuring. In a video commentary for special 3, “The Giggle” (available on BBC iPlayer in the U.K.), EP Russell T. Davies admits that traditional multi-Doctor stories don’t appeal to him as a writer, so he put in the shared scenes between Tennant and Gatwa as a concession to the fans’ desire to see that kind of thing in the 60th anniversary.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>With that mindset from Davies, then, he likely never even considered bringing Smith back. While that’s a shame for Eleventh Doctor enthusiasts, it probably was the right call for these action-packed episodes. Thankfully, it doesn’t seem to have dimmed Smith’s own love for Doctor Who either, as he appeared at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LACC</a> the weekend of “The Giggle”‘s broadcast, and gushed about the character.</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>When it comes to the 70th anniversary, though? It’s either Matt Smith or bust. Geronimo, or geroni-no-thank-you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmrpqrnql6rq3TrWSspZmptW61za%2Bmpa6VmXqquoytn55llKSwtbvRZq6hp11rfbW0jJqlp6Gmmr%2B0rdGyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
