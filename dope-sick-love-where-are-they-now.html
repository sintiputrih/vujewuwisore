It was directed by Felice Conte, Brent Renaud, and Craig Renaud. The 2005 film, which depicts how the cast members battle with their love lives while also trying to overcome their drug addiction, either by being sober or by actually continuing down the path of drug use, shows how the characters try to find a solution to this problem. The movie gained attention thanks to its frank depictions of the hardships of those who deal with drug addiction in real life. We’ve got you covered if, over 18 years after the documentary’s debut, you’re still wondering about the whereabouts of the two couples.</p><h3>Where are Matt and Tracy Now?</h3><p>One of the two couples featured in the film, Matt and Tracy, are said to still be together and have managed to keep their streak of sobriety. The two were purportedly proud parents to Savannah, a 7-year-old daughter, whom they regarded as one of life’s greatest joys as of 2015. Despite this, neither of them appears to be extremely active on social media. We wish Matt and Tracy the very best in life and hope they have a fantastic future ahead of them, regardless of the circumstances.</p><h3>Where are Sebastian and Michelle Now?</h3><p>According to rumours, Michelle may have passed away in 2012, with many people speculating that an overdose may have been the cause. According to reports, Sebastian was “better” in 2012, which gave many members of the public optimism after witnessing his health difficulties on-screen. He must have maintained communication with Matt and Tracy in 2012. Additionally, one of Michelle’s sons—who appeared in the documentary—was supposedly incarcerated in 2012, according to reports. We hope that both parties and their loved ones are content and able to withstand whatever hardships life may throw their way, even though neither party appears to have much of an online presence.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
