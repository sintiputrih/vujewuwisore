The message contained in an encrypted message is referred to as plaintext. In its encrypted, unreadable form it is referred to as ciphertext.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-if-you-encrypt-your-phone></span>What happens if you encrypt your phone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Once an Android device is encrypted, <b>all data stored on the device is locked behind the PIN code, fingerprint, pattern, or password known only to its owner</b>.
