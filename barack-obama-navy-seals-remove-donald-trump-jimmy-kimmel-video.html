His predecessor President <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a> is now joking about what it will take to get Trump to leave the White House if he refuses to go willingly come Jan. 20, 2021, which is Biden‚Äôs inauguration date. During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Nov. 19, Jimmy Kimmel asked the former POTUS if there was ‚Äúa place somebody could hide in the White House if they knew they were going to be removed‚Äù ‚Äî and Obama‚Äôs response was hysterical. ‚ÄúWell, I think we can send some navy seals in to dig him out,‚Äù he replied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Then-President Obama famously used the Navy‚Äôs Seal Team Six to carry out the raid on terrorist <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong>‚Äòs compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 2, 2011, killing the 9-11 mastermind. While Trump of course isn‚Äôt a murderous foreign terrorist, some are beginning to wonder legitimately what will happen if he refuses to commit to a peaceful transition of power, as all presidents have done throughout history. So far Trump has done all he can to obstruct and delay any transition to Biden‚Äôs team, and continues to make <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>denials that Biden won</a> the election. Even former First Lady <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>has begged Trump</a> to honor the respectful transition of power.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>So that‚Äôs why his new book is so long! ü§£ü§£ü§£ <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@BarackObama</a> on Kimmel tonight! <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/hhxTE0qBIj</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>‚Äî Jimmy Kimmel Live (@JimmyKimmelLive) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 19, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Obama appeared on Kimmel to promote his memoir A Promised Land. Jimmy noted that the book is 701 pages long, and asked if the 58-year-old did that on purpose to that the infamously <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reading-averse</a> Trump wouldn‚Äôt pick it up. ‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt think it would have had to be 700 pages,‚Äù for that to happen, Obama joked in return.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This marked the first stop on our 44th president‚Äôs&nbsp; video book tour for his memoir, showing us what a dignified, intelligent and humorous POTUS we had for two terms. During his interview with Kimmel, Obama cracked jokes, told stories about his eight years of life in the White House and got asked the question if he and Michelle ‚Äúmade love‚Äù on the night the of the successful raid that killed bin Laden. Oh yeah, Jimmy went there!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-jokes-navy-seals-donald-trump-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Obama‚Äôs memoir went on sale on Nov. 17, 2020 and should be heading straight to the top of the non-fiction best-sellers list for some time to come. His wife Michelle‚Äôs memoir Becoming was the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>top selling book of 2018</a> after only 15 days on the market, moving two million copies in just over two weeks following its release on Nov. 13, 2018. Within five months it had gone on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide, and became one of the best selling memoirs of all time. While that is a hard act to follow, Barack Obama is probably one of the only people alive whose memoir could overtake wife Michelle‚Äôs monster numbers. What a power couple!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ye5FpZpuZopawrHnOm5immV2jrrfFjKycmqSjYr%2Bmuc6vnGacn6OurbCMramupaBit6q5zLJkpKGdorKtedWim56nXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
