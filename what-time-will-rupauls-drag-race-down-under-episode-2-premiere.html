Not only did the queens question Elektra Shock’s lewk and wig, they also could not get over the fact that she’s competing against both of her bosses. And those bosses? Y’all, Kita Mean and Anita Wigl’it have a simmering rivalry going too. But Elektra showed the competition what she was capable of by winning the screen test mini challenge (with guest appearance from Taika Waititi).</p><p>On the main stage, categories were Born Naked and No Place Like Home. Art Simone stunned in a sparkling sci-fi nude illusion and Melbourne-inspired graffiti cloak look; Scarlet Adams took “born naked” further than anyone in a full body, anatomically correct latex nude suit and then served glamour in a black swan gown; and Karen from Finance took home the win with her campy AF day at the beach glitter bodysuit and fashion-forward day at the races chevron look.</p><figure id=attachment_956836 class="wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"><span class=credit>Photo: World of Wonder</span></figure><p>Elektra Shock and Jojo Zaho landed in the bottom, Elektra for a confusing hometown look and Jojo for not paying attention to the details in either of her looks. The two dueled to “Tragedy” by the Bee Gees and Elektra turned it out. Spins and splits—we may have a lip sync assassin on our hands. And her first victim was Jojo Zaho, who sashayed away.</p><h2>DRAG RACE SPOILERS : What is the&nbsp;RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under&nbsp;elimination order ?</h2><h2>Where can you watch Drag Race Down Under episode 1 online?</h2><p>You can stream RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under Episode 1 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">right now on WOW Presents Plus</a>.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link rel=noopener>Stream&nbsp;RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under&nbsp;on WOW Presents Plus<br></a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp52utXnToqSeZaeeua150a6nmq2cqHqlvsCgZKuZk5p6pbvWp2SuppSav26xz6KqqJyVYn9uvNGepKKdopp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
