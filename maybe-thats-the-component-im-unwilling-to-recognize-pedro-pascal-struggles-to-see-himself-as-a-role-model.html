He wasn’t deemed of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one the most influential people</a> of the year for no reason.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, the actor confessed to his struggle in recognizing himself as an inspiration for others. To him, getting the job done well is the focal aspect of any project he takes on, so being someone’s role model is not something Pascal seems to actively think about:</p><p>“I want to be able to fulfill the assignment and continue to fulfill the assignment. It’s the best part. It’s not necessarily about getting an ‘A’ but understanding someone’s vision and being a scene partner for somebody. If it comes to inspiring somebody else… maybe that’s the component I’m unwilling to recognize. It can make my heart explode a little bit.”</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>While the actor finds this notion difficult to accept, it’s clear that he still appreciates the words of praise. As he should. Pascal deserves all the recognition for his work, and folks will surely keep reminding him of that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S6osXBnmStoJGpwG7Ax55knKedpbyvsc2tZKKlXaq7uLXLpaCnn12pvG6%2BxJymoKaZr7JuvMSdqahloJbApK3LZqqtqqWctK2x0marqGWjmrJutMimqp6klmKutHnAZqmopJViurCwxKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
