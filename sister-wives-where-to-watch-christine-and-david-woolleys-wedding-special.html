They announced their relationship on Valentine’s Day this year, with the couple getting engaged just two months later. Christine has described David as the “love of [her] life” on her social media channels, revealing that the pair bonded over both having large families. With this familiarity, Christine has stated that David was very understanding of her experience with polygamy, and that “we just clicked and it was easy.”</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Christine and David united their families in a recent October wedding ceremony, attended by family and friends. The nuptials have been subject to significant interest by Sister Wives viewers, especially over who may – or may not – have attended the ceremony, which will soon be revealed in the TV special.</p><p data-characters=32 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official press release</a> says:</p><p>“After years of struggling in her plural marriage to Kody, Christine Brown has met the love of her life — David Woolley.

Part two will air the following week, on January 14th, at the same time on the TLC channel. For streaming access, the special should be available on TLC’s official partnered streamer, Discovery Plus, where all eighteen seasons of Sister Wives are available.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=false>It should be noted that the special is separate from Sister Wives, which saw the season eighteen finale and reunion special air this month. Season nineteen of Sister Wives has not officially been announced by TLC, but the fact that the network is keeping the former wives of Kody Brown in its stratosphere makes it most likely that the long-running reality series will continue in some form, even if the Brown family is no longer polygamist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0tdKtnKtlp57Dpr%2BMsJ%2BeqpViwbB51pqrnKBdmLWztdKtoKedXZa7pXnDmq2inF2svLC4y56wrGWnmrGltc2gZKyolZi2oriO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
