Months after undergoing a preventive double mastectomy to remove both breasts and reduce her risk of cancer, the Maleficent actress, 37, can still rock a plunging neckline like no one else. And on Monday, July 8, she did just that <a href=#>while in Hawaii on a location-scouting trip</a>.</p><p>Wearing a low-cut camisole and black pants, Jolie revealed her stunning figure and still-ample cleavage. She kept her eyes hidden behind a pair of sunglasses and beneath a wide-brimmed black hat, but her smile was unmistakable.</p><p>Indeed, the Academy Award-winning star has a lot to be happy about these days. Thanks to her preventive mastectomy in February, her chances of developing breast cancer have decreased from 87 percent to 5 percent, she revealed in a May <a href=#>New York Times editorial</a> about the procedure.</p><p>"I can tell my children that they don’t need to fear they will lose me to breast cancer," she wrote of her six kids with fiance <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>. "It is reassuring that they see nothing that makes them uncomfortable. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was."</p><p>"There have been many advances in [reconstructive surgery] in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful," she added, noting that she did not feel like "any less of a woman" without her natural breasts. "I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity," she explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jolie arrived in Honolulu on Sunday, July 7, with sons Maddox, 11, and Pax, 9. She's in town to scout locations in advance of the upcoming movie Unbroken, her first project since undergoing her mastectomy.</p><p>"Angelina was smiling," a source told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>."[She] talked to several people at the gate who greeted her and her sons with 'alohas' and 'enjoy your vacation.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaappeauaq6wGahqKSZmnqzsdWemKWrXaW8tMCMppisrJWYwbC52GaZqJypYravecuormabpal6pK3MoqqopJVivaqv066pnmViZX50hZZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
