My post was in no way intended to be insensitive to their truth,” she wrote. “Personally, I know from friends and family that such abuse has lifelong residual effects. My heartfelt wish is for healing.” Howard University snowballed with its own <a href=#>statement</a> soon thereafter, saying that while Rashad’s tweet “lacked sensitivity” toward Cosby’s survivors, “personal positions of university leadership do not reflect Howard’s policies.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>FINALLY!!!!

In 2015, Rashad said in an interview <a href=#>with Showbiz 411</a> that she was skeptical of the <a href=#>vast number of sexual-assault allegations being lodged against Cosby</a>. “Forget these women,” she explained. “What you’re seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it’s orchestrated. I don’t know why or who’s doing it, but it’s the legacy. And it’s a legacy that is so important to the culture.” However, Rashad later <a href=#>claimed</a> the outlet misquoted her words and insisted that “this is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckqo8j9y500093h6i19qt03a7@published data-word-count=125><strong>Updated on July 3: </strong>On Friday, July 2, Phylicia Rashad sent an apology letter to Howard University students and parents after sharing (and later deleting) a tweet celebrating Bill Cosby’s release from prison for sexual assault. <a href=#>According to CNN,</a> the letter reads: “My remarks were in no way directed towards survivors of sexual assault. I vehemently oppose sexual violence, find no excuse for such behavior, and I know that Howard University has a zero-tolerance policy toward interpersonal violence,” and that she plans “to engage in active listening and participate in trainings to not only reinforce University protocol and conduct, but also to learn how I can become a stronger ally to sexual assault survivors and everyone who has suffered at the hands of an abuser.”</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckqjweg350000kqon5tqb4395@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>All Your Questions About Bill Cosby’s Overturned Verdict, Answered</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Phylicia Rashad Walks Back Celebratory Bill Cosby Tweet</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdgbHyxtNiloJyhkWK%2For%2FHmptmm5iWu6ix0maZoqScYrCwv8GyZKydqKqurXnArKqarZyperTAwK2cpp2eqXupwMyl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
