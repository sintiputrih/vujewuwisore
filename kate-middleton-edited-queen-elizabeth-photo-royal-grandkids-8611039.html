The shot featured the monarch sitting front and center, with all of her great-grandchildren — including Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis — that was taken by Middleton and later released by Buckingham Palace. The photo was allegedly taken by Middleton at Balmoral Castle last summer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Getty has since found several inconsistencies with the images, after royal observers uncovered multiple Photoshop blunders with the image. “Getty Images has reviewed the image in question and placed an editor’s note on it, stating that the image has been digitally enhanced at source,” a Getty spokesperson told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Telegraph</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The update comes on the heels of Middleton's Photoshop controversy on Mother's Day, in which she shared a photo of herself, surrounded by George, Charlotte and Louis for the occasion, and posted it to the Kensington Royal social accounts. Again, royal observers found several editing inconsistencies, notably with her around her hair and Charlotte's blouse. Shortly after, news and photo agencies, such as The Associate Press, AFP and Reuters, recalled the images from their websites for being altered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Middleton later explained the what happened with the image in a statement issued through her and Prince William's X and Instagram accounts. Her explanation for the mishap was that she went overboard with editing the picture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused," she wrote. "I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.
