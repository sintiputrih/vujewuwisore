She showed an early interest in the arts and made her acting debut in a play while she was in kindergarten. She was thrilled to get cast in In The Dark despite a few setbacks.</p><h3><span id=She_Really_Is_Blind>She Really Is Blind</span></h3><p>In The Dark was criticised from the outset for not using a blind actor to portray the show’s visually challenged lead. Even though that might have been a squandered chance, the show had great success with the casting of Calle’s Chloe Riley character. After surviving a brain tumour that permanently destroyed her optic nerve, Calle has been legally blind for a number of years. As you may guess, losing her vision was a very difficult thing for her to accept, but she has continued to be optimistic.</p><h3><span id=Shes_Not_Into_Social_Media>She’s Not Into Social Media</span></h3><p>It’s difficult to imagine there are still people who don’t utilise social media in this day and age. Calle doesn’t appear to have any official social media pages, and it’s unknown if she ever did. Given that she is a somewhat private person, this isn’t all that shocking.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a6d9c31de181434e9e192b6314ad4948-1.jpg alt="in the dark cast,calle walton head injury,calle walton wikipedia,calle walton gender,calle walton blind,calle walton hairstyle,calle walton instagram,calle walton imdb,calle walton headband,calle walton hair jewelry,calle walton interview,calle walton movies,how old is calle walton" width=640 height=457 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=In_The_Dark_is_Her_Only_TV_Role>In The Dark is Her Only TV Role</span></h3><p>For some people, it may take years of trying out for roles in the entertainment industry. Fortunately for Calle, things haven’t turned out that way for her. Calle’s first acting role, In The Dark, is also her only previous on-screen credit. In the upcoming years, hopefully, her resume will be much lengthier.</p><h3><span id=Shes_Pretty_Different_From_Her_Character>She’s Pretty Different From Her Character</span></h3><p>Although Calle and Chloe both have blindness, that is pretty much where their similarities end. Calle told the Monadnock Ledger Transcript that her role was very dissimilar to her. My character Chloe is a little more restrained, shy, and insecure than I am, who I believe to be a bit more cheerful, active, and gregarious.</p><h3><span id=Shes_From_New_Hampshire>She’s From New Hampshire</span></h3><p>Though it’s doubtful that New Hampshire is the first or final place that comes to mind when people consider the entertainment sector, Calle resides there. Calle appears to still live in the Peterborough region of New Hampshire where she was born and reared. She doesn’t seem to be thinking about moving.</p><h3><span id=Family_Is_Important_to_Her>Family Is Important to Her</span></h3><p>Calle, as was already established, is a very private person. As a result, there isn’t much information known about her family life. We do know that she comes from a supportive and close-knit family, though. She has an especially close relationship with her mother.</p><h3><span id=Its_Unclear_If_Shes_Had_Formal_Acting_Training>It’s Unclear If She’s Had Formal Acting Training</span></h3><p>Despite the fact that we are aware of Calle’s lifelong passion in performing, we were unable to locate any details regarding her professional acting instruction. According to what we’ve learned, she made the decision to start the audition process for In The Dark immediately away, taking on a challenging assignment without any prior expertise.</p><h3><span id=She_Eventually_Wants_to_Get_Into_Teaching>She Eventually Wants to Get Into Teaching</span></h3><p>Calle genuinely enjoys acting, but that isn’t the only thing she wants to do with her life. She intends to eventually follow in her mother’s career path and work as a teacher. It appears very likely that Calle will be as well-known in the classroom as she is on television.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ITD208b_0153bc-750x536-1.jpg alt="in the dark cast,calle walton head injury,calle walton wikipedia,calle walton gender,calle walton blind,calle walton hairstyle,calle walton instagram,calle walton imdb,calle walton headband,calle walton hair jewelry,calle walton interview,calle walton movies,how old is calle walton" width=750 height=536 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=She_Isnt_Actually_a_Teenager>She Isn’t Actually a Teenager</span></h3><p>Calle’s trip on In The Dark began when she was a teenager, but that is no longer the case. She is actually a few years older than the persona she plays in real life. Although there are various reports about her exact age, it seems like she is at least 20 years old.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="in the dark cast,calle walton head injury,calle walton wikipedia,calle walton gender,calle walton blind,calle walton hairstyle,calle walton instagram,calle walton imdb,calle walton headband,calle walton hair jewelry,calle walton interview,calle walton movies,how old is calle walton" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
