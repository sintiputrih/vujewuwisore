However, moles can also develop through sun exposure as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best way to prevent moles from growing in the first place is by taking measures to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>protect your skin</a> from ultraviolet radiation," explains Dr. Choi Kim. The MD suggests avoiding being outdoors during peak sun intensity hours, which falls between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., as well as using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>SPF 30 or higher</a> daily, and avoiding tanning beds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-all-moles-need-to-be-checked></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do All Moles Need to Be Checked?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Alexis Stephens</a>, a dermatologist at Parkland Dermatology, stresses the importance of getting annual mole checks. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that your doctor will need to remove or closely examine every mole on your body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Almost every adult has moles, and this is normal. Most people have between 10 to 40 moles," Dr. Choi Kim assures us. "In your lifetime, some of the moles you develop may darken or lighten and grow gradually over years."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, if you are someone with over 50 moles on your body, it's important to keep in mind that you are at higher risk for developing melanoma. But if caught early, the disease is highly treatable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In adults, new moles or changes in existing moles should be checked regularly, both at home with self-exams and also with an annual total body skin exam by a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>board-certified dermatologist</a>," Dr. Choi Kim adds. "Dermatologists spend years training their eyes to examine moles and may use tools like a dermatoscope to better evaluate features of moles."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-doctors-determine-when-a-mole-needs-to-be-removed></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do Doctors Determine When a Mole Needs to Be Removed?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By following the alphabet â€” literally.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If a mole is showing one of the signs of the ABCDEs, it is important to have it evaluated for removal," says Dr. Stephens. "A is for asymmetry, B is for the border is changing or raised, C is for change in color, D is for the diameter is bigger than a pencil eraser, and E is for evolving or changing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Choi Kim adds that she also looks for the "ugly duckling sign" when examining the skin for suspicious moles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Does one mole obviously stand out from the others?" she questions when doing check-ups.

Then the MD will decide whether to do a shave biopsy, a punch biopsy, or a surgical excision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You may or may not receive stitches depending on the type of removal performed," says Dr. Choi Kim. "In all cases, the mole will be sent to a pathologist to examine it under a microscope and to check for precancerous or cancerous cells," she continues. "Based on the results, you may need to return to the office for a second appointment to have the mole completely removed and treated."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Stephens adds that you can either see a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for the removal process, but the mole should always be examined by a dermatologist prior.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-healing-process-like-post-mole-removal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is the Healing Process Like Post-Mole Removal?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Stephens advises that healing can take anywhere from one to two weeks, however, this can differ depending on the type of removal procedure you had done.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A shave biopsy wound typically takes several days to weeks to heal, depending on the size and location of the mole that was removed," Dr. Choi Kim explains. "After a shave biopsy, a scab will form. Do not pick it off early. Once it does fall off, the skin underneath will be pink and smooth. If your mole is removed with stitches, your dermatologist will have you return to the office to have them removed in one to two weeks depending on the location on the body."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's also important to note that regardless of the removal process your doctor chooses, scarring is likely to occur. However, there are ways to minimize the appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Silicone gel or bandages can help with healing and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>preventing scarring</a>," says Dr. Stephens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Choi Kim adds that proper sun protection is also key to avoiding the darkening of the area. "If you develop an itchy, painful, or raised scar called a keloid, see your dermatologist for treatment options such as cortisone injections and lasers," she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-a-mole-thats-been-previously-been-removed-grow-back></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can a Mole That's Been Previously Been Removed Grow Back?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ah, moles. They can truly be the gift that keeps on giving. So in other words, yes, they can definitely grow back. And if that's the case for you, then it's time to make another appointment with your dermatologist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Moles can grow back after shave biopsies, punch biopsies, and even surgical excisions if there are nests of pigmented cells left at the borders," Dr. Choi Kim explains. "If a mole grows back, your dermatologist will look at the recurrent mole on your skin and review the original pathology results to determine whether it is medically necessary to remove again."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1opKiklWK%2FprnOr5il</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
