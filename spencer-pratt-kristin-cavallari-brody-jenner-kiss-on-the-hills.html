So, I can’t wait to actually tune in just to [see] that part. See how close — I think she said, ‘Kiss me,’ and he did it.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Justin Bobby Brescia</strong></a> chimed in, telling Us that <a href=#><strong>Audrina Patridge</strong></a> was there when the smooch happened. “I was behind the rock, spying,” Patridge, 35, confirmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spencer-Pratt-Claims-Exes-Kristin-Cavallari-and-Brody-Jenner-Kissed-During-Her-Hills-Return.jpg><p>Jenner, however, played coy about the hookup speculation. “I don’t know. Did we kiss? I mean, [I was] pretty tired that morning,” he explained. “I think Audrina and I stayed up all night the night before and the night before that.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Princes of Malibu alum</a>, 37, noted that seeing the former <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a> star, 34, again was great, as always.</p><p>“Kristin and I, we dated for a while <a href=#>back in the day</a>. We’ve always maintained a great friendship,” he told Us. “She’s so much fun. She’s so great at filming. She’s been doing this for so long and she’s such a professional. She comes in, she knows how to bring it.”</p><p>The Los Angeles native continued: “She came right in like a tornado and stirred up the drama. She knows how to get it out of people. It’s always a pleasure.”</p><p>Jenner also gushed over his former flame, <a href=#>who he dated when she was 18 years old</a>, and how little she’s changed through the years. “She looks incredible. Like, for real, she has three kids. I mean, she’s worked her butt off and she looks so good,” he said. “Like, it’s crazy. I couldn’t even believe how incredible she looks.”</p><p>Pratt seconded Jenner’s kind words, telling Us how great it was to have the Uncommon James founder back in L.A. with some of their <a href=#>original Hills cast members</a>.</p><p>“I prayed for that one, <a href=#>so answered prayers</a>. I look forward to having more Kristin on the show in the future,” he said. “She’s so fun. She’s so real, always on camera. She comes up authentic and I feel like Kristin is Kristin. She doesn’t play a character or anything or self-edit or something. I enjoy having her with the group.”</p><p>Cavallari, for her part, <a href=#>teased her reality TV return last month</a>, exclusively telling Us that she isn’t the one stirring the pot this time around.</p><p>“No drama — at least not about me,” the <a href=#>Very Cavallari alum</a> said in April. “I filmed one episode, so what could you really do?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although her time on the show was brief, the True Comfort author revealed it was “<a href=#>so much fun</a>” being back with her pals, including Jenner, Patridge and Pratt’s wife<strong>, <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a></strong>.</p><p>“I had such a great time. It was like no time had passed,” Cavallari told Us. “I’m really happy that I was able to do it.”</p><p>The Hills: New Beginnings premieres on MTV Wednesday, May 12, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqpnZ6YsrN5z6uYraxdoL%2Bqv9OipWabkauurbjAq6BmmqKksbp5yZ6lp52iYriqv9JmpqdlpJ2ybrTIpaOsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
