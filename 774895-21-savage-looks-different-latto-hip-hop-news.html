"Latto whatchu feeding him," one fan asks in 2cool2bl0g's comments section. "Why does 21 look like that now," another wonders under Khaled's original post. Anyone else see that?"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-21-savage-links-up-with-dj-khaled>21 Savage Links Up With DJ Khaled</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, it's fun to imagine that Latto throwing down in the kitchen is what led to the rapper's transformation. With that being said, however, the duo has yet to even confirm that they're an item. Moreover, many fans note that it's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">completely normal</a> for one's look to change over the years, as nobody stays the same forever.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While 21 Savage and Latto's rumored relationship continues to spark debate, he seemingly <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">debuted a new tattoo</a> earlier this year, which many commenters believe is a tribute to the "Put It On Da Floor" performer. The tattoo, which is located behind one of his ears, says Latto's birth name, "Alyssa." Latto is speculated to have a similar tattoo of his name "Sheyaa," also behind her ear. What do you think of social media users blaming Latto for 21 Savage's apparent new look? Do you agree that she's responsible?
