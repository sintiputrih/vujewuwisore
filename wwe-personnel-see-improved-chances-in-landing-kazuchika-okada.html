The multi-time IGWP Heavyweight Champion has competed in some of the best matches in recent memory. Okada is already in the news as his NJPW contract will expire soon and now WWE personnel believe they might be able to sign Okada.</p><p>The Rainmaker has been part of NJPW since 2007 and is hailed as one of the greatest pro wrestlers of all time for good reason, but that might be ending soon. As previously reported, Kazuchika Okada is set to become a<a href=#> free agent at the end of January next year</a>.</p><p><a href=#>It was previously reported</a>&nbsp;that WWE has their eye on Kazuchika Okada and there is a chance&nbsp;WWE will end up snatching him up&nbsp;once he becomes a free agent if AEW doesn’t give him a big enough offer.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer noted that WWE certainly has an interest in signing Kazuchika Okada and many in the company now believe they have a better chance at signing Okada than ever before.</p><p>“I think it’s kind of like overplayed in some ways. I mean, at the same time, when I wrote about it, it’s like it’s true. WWE wants Okada. They wanted Okada for how many years? But they do believe that maybe there’s a better chance of getting him now than before. And maybe there is.”</p><p>Kazuchika Okada still has a match&nbsp;<a href=#>against Bryan Danielson at Wrestle Kingdom 18 on January 4, 2024</a>. It remains to be seen whether he will end up calling WWE his home somewhere down the line.</p><p>What’s your opinion on this story? Do you want to see Kazuchika Okada in WWE?
