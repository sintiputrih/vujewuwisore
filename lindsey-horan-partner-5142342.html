Find out more about Tyler and his relationship with Lindsey here!</p><h2>How did Lindsey and Tyler meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Like Lindsey, Tyler is also ingrained in the soccer world, but don’t expect to see him on the field. When Lindsey was preparing for the 2019 Women’s World Cup, Tyler was working behind the scenes for the U.S. Soccer Federation. They reportedly met while she was in training at camp for the USWNT, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>First Sportz.</a> While Lindsey was getting ready for the tournament, Tyler was the manager of analytics and research, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>.</p><h2>Tyler works for AS Monaco</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tyler has spent most of his career working in sports and specifically in soccer. Currently, he serves as the Head of Sporting Technology and Insights for the Association Sportive de Monaco Football Club. He’s held the position since February 2021. Prior to that, he worked for the U.S. Soccer Federation, with his last position being the Director of Sporting Analytics. Before that he had worked for software company Ceridian, but he also had coaching and trainer positions.</p><h2>Tyler played soccer at Augsburg University</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>While most of his work is off the field, Tyler also had time that he played soccer. He was a defender at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, Minnesota from 2010 to 2012, where he was also a mathematics major. He also played football and basketball in high school, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>player page.</a></p><h2>They got engaged in 2023</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Lindsey and Tyler got engaged in June 2023. The soccer player announced that her now-fiancé had popped the question on June 16 in an Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>. She shared photos of Tyler down on one knee in front of a scenic mountain, as well as close-ups showing off her engagement ring. “My heart is, and always will be, yours,” she wrote in the caption.</p><h2>Lindsey regularly posts photos with Tyler on Instagram</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>While Tyler keeps his social media private, Lindsay often shares cute photos of the two of them on her social media. She’s shared cute shots of him during birthday festivities, during <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>travels</a>, and the occasional cute <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>selfie</a>. The soccer star gushed about Tyler on his birthday back in April, with a loving <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>caption</a>. “Happy birthday my love. I cannot wait to celebrate with you today and this weekend!! Our time is never everrrr long enough but I think we’ve done a pretty good job at making it as special as possible. I love you so much & see you soon,” she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uipZ2rla56qbvRmqVmqJGnwa%2Bx0WZsamxiaIFzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
