Reframe Christmas</strong></h3><p id=edCsyly1enn5 data-wc=10>"First things first, reframe the typical Christmas stereotype," says Emily.</p><p id=e1qLGTtbv_su data-wc=59>"Ultimately, no matter how a person spends Christmas, their intention is to feel joy, and there is no reason that you can’t feel joy when spending Christmas alone. Christmas Day is a chance to press pause on fast-paced 21st-century life, and spending the day alone presents a rare opportunity where you can do whatever you want, whenever you want.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why don't I feel festive this year?

Whether it’s reading a book, partaking in some meditation or even cleaning. If it gives you a sense of accomplishment or joy – put it on the list!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/67d35d3969ac-christmas-alone.jpg><h3><strong>2. Structure the day</strong></h3><p id=e9GPA6JGt2I6 data-wc=52>"If you are dreading spending Christmas Day alone, it can be easy to put off thinking about it, says Emily. "Instead, structure the day so you know exactly what you’re going to do and when you’re going to do it. This will avoid a sense of boredom kicking in or negative feelings."</p><p id=eh6dnJ4_mnwD data-wc=9><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Busy December? You need to try 'snackable wellness'</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>3. Treat yourself</strong></h3><p id=eX8Y_9WmHanT data-wc=41>"Spending Christmas alone doesn’t mean that you cannot receive gifts," says Emily. "Purchase a gift for yourself that you wouldn’t usually buy, large, or small. Don’t open it until Christmas Day and even wrap it to make it feel extra special."</p><p id=eTYkEAWvo7FE data-wc=44>Emily is right that treating ourselves is key to happiness;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>studies have shown that treating ourselves leaves us feeling less exhausted</a> and with a greater sense of happiness and life satisfaction – if that's not what Christmas is for, we don't know what is!</p><h3><strong>4. Indulge in guilt-free self-care</strong></h3><p id=e-z8jwyabjeJ data-wc=19>Many of us feel guilty for spending time on ourselves, but consider Christmas Day the ultimate opportunity for this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5553544410f-alone-christmas.jpg><p id=en1LbKN6To0U data-wc=58>"Empower Christmas Day by declaring it a guilt-free 24 hours," Emily encourages. "If you can’t be bothered or are not a fan of a roast dinner, make your favourite meal instead. Binge watch your favourite TV shows with your favourite snacks, have a bath with candles. Do all your favourite things, and do not feel guilty about it."</p><p id=eAu0fKLQ6ReV data-wc=11><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Is this the reason we're all so exhausted right now?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>5. Ignore comparison culture</strong></h3><p id=eOg-zzeHod_7 data-wc=47>"Stay away from social media on Christmas Day," encourages Emily. "Chances are, your connections are going to be posting the highlights of their day. Remember, these are just their highlights. If social media is likely to rob the day of joy, delete the apps for the day."</p><h3><strong>6. Go for a Christmas walk</strong></h3><p id=eROJr1uGIJjS data-wc=54>Research shows that surrounding yourself with nature can improve your mental wellbeing and see your whole body relax. "Being in nature lowers the stress hormone cortisol and has even been shown to lower blood pressure," explains Emily. "Scheduling in a walk when spending Christmas alone can boost your mood and chat to other people."</p><p id=eLVj9A7AQHru data-wc=17><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I went for a walk every day - here's what it did to my stress levels</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>7. Remember it's just 24 hours</strong></h3><p id=eHq2OHIaosh3 data-wc=44>"Christmas Day has the same 24 hours as any other day of the year and you don’t have to celebrate it at all," says Emily. "If you feel that acknowledging the day will conjure to many negative feelings, refrain from celebrating it at all."</p><p id=eDWKrR_ennWQ data-wc=24>Those 24 hours will pass just as quickly, there's no reason to mark them if you don't want!
