Kylie is also <a class=hm-link href=#>a mom to two children</a> with her <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>on-again-off-again partner</a></strong> of several years Travis Scott. But just how much is Kylie worth today, and how did the pop culture icon come to make her fortune? <strong></strong> finds out...&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How much is Kylie Jenner worth in 2023?</strong></h2><p id=ekrfAZjX8LbC data-wc=46>According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Forbes</a>, Kylie's net worth currently stands at around $600million (around £480million). In March 2019, the magazine reported that she had become the "youngest self-made billionaire," believing she had been able to make this vast amount of money through her 100% ownership of Kylie Cosmetics.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYpemKPd1NB data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Ever wondered who the richest Kardashian is?

"Filings released by publicly traded Coty over the past six months lay bare one of the family’s best-kept secrets: Kylie’s business is significantly smaller, and less profitable, than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe," the magazine reported.</p><p id=eS4A2fgph9f data-wc=10><strong>SEE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Bad news for Kylie Jenner and her beauty business</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eqoHTUesefTS data-wc=68>Following the article's publication, Kylie and Kris Jenner's representatives hit back with a statement which quoted on its website as saying: "The accusations that the Jenners, and/or their accountants, falsified tax returns and then lied about their 2016 revenues for the last four years, are absolutely false." Whatever the exact number of Kylie Jenner's fortune, no doubt surrounds the fact that it is an impressive number, however.</p><h2><strong>How much does Kylie Jenner earn per month?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/45abb73476fb-kylie-jenner-net-worth-met-gala.jpg><p id=elHZcjGxbdKe data-wc=47>Due to the nature of Kylie Jenner's work as <a class=hm-link href=#>a reality TV star</a>, businesswoman and influencer, it is difficult to estimate exactly how much the 25-year-old makes each month. For certain, the number likely varies quite a bit, but her per-month fortune likely averages somewhere between $20-50million.</p><h2><strong>What is Kylie Jenner's job?</strong></h2><p id=eS_xYI7NAbMr data-wc=60>As well as being a TV star and popular figure on social media, Kylie is a businesswoman and has had many lucrative ventures over the last few years. In 2015, the successful socialite launched a <a class=hm-link href=#>hugely popular Topshop fashion line</a> with her sister Kendall Jenner. She has also fronted campaigns for big brands such as Calvin Klein, Beats and Adidas.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/03efd7f589a1-kylie-jenner-net-worth-top-shop.jpg><p id=enDwVUhz0_UP data-wc=51>Following her <a class=hm-link href=#>successful clothing range</a> at Topshop, in August 2015 the then-teenager announced that she would be launching <a class=hm-link href=#>her first lipstick line</a> as part of her new company Kylie Lip Kit. This name was then <a class=hm-link href=#>changed to Kylie Cosmetics</a>, which expanded its product range and became hugely popular, in February 2016.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6g5NGzYet6a data-wc=48>Kylie also makes money through advertising products through sponsored posts on her social media. In 2019, news that she was making over $1.2million per sponsored Instagram post practically broke the internet, as the young star immediately became recognised as one the highest paid individual influencers on the platform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9080153d719a-kylie-jenner-net-worth-stormi.jpg><p id=eM3iOkemboVq data-wc=43>Of course, in addition to moneymaking, Kylie is also <a class=hm-link href=#>a dedicated mom</a> to her two children with rapper Travis Scott. Both their <a class=hm-link href=#>five-year-old daughter Stormi</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>one-year-old son Aire</a> regularly make appearances alongside their mom in posts on her lucrative social media accounts.</p><h2><strong>How is Kylie so rich?</strong></h2><p id=edarVcYwazrH data-wc=49>As the daughter of Olympic champion <a class=hm-link href=#>Caitlyn Jenner</a> and TV personality <a class=hm-link href=#>Kris Jenner</a>, Kylie was born into quite a bit of money. However, when Kylie was around nine years old, after her family became famous from starring in the reality TV show everything changed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/0d87455248de-kylie-jenner-net-worth-family.jpg><p id=eUUDn3nYMD70 data-wc=48>Since that show's first success in 2007, Kylie's profile has been raised thanks to it and its spin-offs' continued popularity, the business opportunities which have come from it and the huge social media following she has succeeded to gain from capitalizing on the interest shown into her life.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMJ3fkeOXtW7 data-wc=47>In February 2018, Kylie's <a class=hm-link href=#>photo of her baby daughter</a> became the 'most liked' Instagram post ever. And while that record has now been surpassed, the star undoubtedly continues to know how to best use her popularity with the public in business, on TV, and on social media.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The Kardashians in 60 seconds</figure><p id=elpCG1QjV4w data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
